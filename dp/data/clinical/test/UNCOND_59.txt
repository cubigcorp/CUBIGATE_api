Doctor: Hi sir, let me start by getting your age.
Guest_family: He is fifty three!
Doctor: So, tell me what's going on?
Guest_family: He is complaining of so many things but-
Patient: But I have a lot of pain from my hernia. That's the number one complaint, but I am also having pain in my lower legs.
Guest_family: He has so many issues going on with him, that is why I got him to emergency.
Patient: My wife freaks out easily. 
Doctor: Don't worry, let me take a look. So, any nausea and or vomiting? 
Patient: Yes both. And I am not sure, but I think I noticed some blood in my stool.
Doctor: Oh, but you are not sure?
Patient: It is questionable!
Doctor: I see. And on the scale of one to ten, ten being severe, how will you rate your lower extremity pain?
Patient: Actually, my leg pain has improved considerably. I did have more significant tingling and numbness in the past but now it has improved a great deal.
Doctor: Hm.
Guest_family: He has so many medical issues. Here, I have gotten his reports. You can look at them Doctor.

Patient: Well, yeah.
Doctor: There is a reason why your wife is worried. So, are you taking any medicines currently?

Patient: Yeah, but I am still taking it.
