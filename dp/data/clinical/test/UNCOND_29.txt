Doctor: Hi, there. How are you doing? 
Patient: I think I have some sort of condition.
Doctor: Why do you say that? 
Patient: My body has been feeling weird lately. 
Doctor: I see. Is there anything that runs in your family?
Patient: I know a lot of my family has some sort of heart problem. We have high blood pressure and blood sugar. There's one more thing. It starts with a C. Something to do with the brain. Do you know?
Doctor: Is it cerebrovascular disease?
Patient: There you go. How'd you get that so fast?
Doctor: I guess I know my stuff.
