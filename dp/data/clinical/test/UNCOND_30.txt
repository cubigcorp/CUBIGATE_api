Doctor: Hi mister Jones.  Do you remember me from the last time you were here? How old are you now?
Patient: I am fifty two. Yes doc. I remember you. 
Doctor: What have you been using most recently? I need to know what kind of drugs we are dealing with. 
Patient: I gotta kick the heroin. It's going to kill me this time. Please help me. My whole body hurts. I am so cold. 
Doctor: Okay. Is there anything else that you been using recently? Alcohol? Pills? 
Patient: I did some coke. It's this heroin that is going to get me. I used to abuse alcohol, but now I have switched to drugs.
