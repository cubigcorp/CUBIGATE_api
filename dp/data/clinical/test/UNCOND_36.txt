Doctor: I looked at your labs. Everything looks normal for the most part. You do have abnormal levels for Sodium and Creatinine which are related to your kidneys. Then your thyroid levels are not normal as well. 
Patient: How about my E K G? I had a negative pregnancy test.
Doctor: Oh yes that. Your E K G showed a higher heart rate of one twenty two per minute. We will evaluate everything further.
