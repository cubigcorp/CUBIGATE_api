Doctor: I looked over your report from urgent care. 
Patient: They didn't do much other than tell me to follow up with you.  
Doctor: Given that you're sensitive to light and feel nauseated, I believe a migraine is highly likely. 
Patient: Can I take anything for it? 
Doctor: I'm going to prescribe you Tylenol with codeine to help your pain. 
Patient: Can I get a doctor's note, too? 
Doctor: Yes. In fact, I'd like you to take a day off from school and rest until you start to feel better. 
Patient: Okay. Thank you.
