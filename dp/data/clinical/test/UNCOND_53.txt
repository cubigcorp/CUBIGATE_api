Doctor: How are you Miss G? 
Patient: I am good doctor, thank you for asking. 
Doctor: So, tell me what is going on?
Patient: I have this ear pain and headache for some time. It's better than before but I still want to get it checked. 
Doctor: Okay, when exactly did it start?
Patient: Um, almost three weeks ago. I am having difficulty hearing. I also feel this pressure on the left side of my sinus causing tooth pain. I went to my dentist yesterday, but my teeth are fine. 
Doctor: Okay, do you have headache now?
Patient: No, just ear pain and this jaw pain on the left side. 
Doctor: Any fever, cough, sore throat, or any cold like symptoms? 
Patient: No, but I have a sinus problem and I suffer from chronic left sided headache.
Doctor: How old are you?
Patient: Oh, I am forty nine.
Doctor: Hm, so are you taking any medications for your pain?
Patient: No, currently I am just using Cutivate for my eczema. It has helped me a lot, I do need a refill for it. 
Doctor: Okay I will send a prescription for it to your pharmacy.
