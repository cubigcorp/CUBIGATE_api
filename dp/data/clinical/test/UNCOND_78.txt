Doctor: Do you drink or smoke? Or take any other kind of drugs? 
Patient: I used to smoke and drink, but I quit years ago. Maybe it was like in ninety two.
Doctor: How many cigarettes were you smoking then? 
Patient: You see that is a tough one to remember. It was anywhere around thirty packs per year.
