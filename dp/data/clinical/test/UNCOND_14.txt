Doctor: How old are you, sir? 
Patient: I am sixty two year old African American. 
Doctor: Do you have any relevant past medical history? 
Patient: I do have diabetes, high blood pressure and I had a stroke in the year two thousand and two. I do have weakness on my right side after that. I also had two heart attacks. Ah. 
Doctor: Any history of surgery? 
Patient: I have a pacemaker. 
Doctor: It shows here that you came to us in two thousand and one for weakness and numbness in your legs. How is that now? 
Patient: Oh, it was never gone. Instead, it has also moved to my hands and areas above my knees. 
Doctor: What are your symptoms now? 
Patient: It's mostly like something is burning and numbness is still there. 
Doctor: Is that your main concern? 
Patient: Yeah, it is. That is my main problem. I do have pain, but it is not that much of a concern. 
Patient: For the last six months, I cannot feel anything hot in my hands. Things slip out of my hand. I don't have any weakness as such, but it's just like that feeling of clumsiness and it's just lots of sensation. 
Patient: Sometimes I feel, like, these jerks in my body, mainly my shoulders and both hands. 
Doctor: Has it been for some time? 
Patient: It has been like forever but now I am noticing it more than before. 
Doctor: Do you get any kind of tremors? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: Any neck pain? 
Patient: No, but as you might have noticed I am using this walker because I do not feel safe walking. 
Doctor: Have you used anything for your pain? 
Patient: Yeah, they tried different medicines but only oxycodone helped a little. It does give me sometimes around three hours of relief. Gabapentin did not work at all. 
Doctor: How is your sleep?
Patient: I cannot sleep properly because of the pain. It has been for many years. I haven't had a proper sleep. 
Doctor: When did you get your pacemaker? 
Patient: It was around six months ago after the heart attack and pacemaker I was transferred to a nursing home. There they stopped my insulin and since then, I'm taking tablets for that. 
Doctor: Do you have any back pain?
Patient: Nope. 
Doctor: Any change in bathroom routine? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: Did you ever have any accidents or any injury before all this started? 
Patient: No, nothing like that.
