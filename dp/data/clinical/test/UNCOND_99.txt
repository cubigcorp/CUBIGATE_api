Doctor: I'm glad to hear that your Afib is under control. I'd like for you to start taking baby aspirin again. 
Patient: Should I continue taking Nexium? 
Doctor: Yes, I'd like you to also take Nexium forty M G once a day in order to reduce the risk of an upper G I bleed. 
Patient: Sounds good.  
Doctor: And I ask that you call me immediately if you notice coffee like grounds in your vomit or bloody stool. 
Patient: Okay.  
Doctor: If you have either of these symptoms, then we'll need to put a stop to aspirin.
