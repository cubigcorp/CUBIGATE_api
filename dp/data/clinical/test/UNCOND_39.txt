Doctor: How are you related to the patient?
Guest_family: I am his friend; I work with him in a coffee shop. He works as a cook there.
Doctor: Can you tell me your age? 
Patient: I'm forty one. 
Doctor: Can you tell me what exactly happened? 
Guest_family: He was cooking, and the hot oil splashed onto his arm. 
Doctor: Did this happen in the coffee shop kitchen?
Patient: Yes. I don't know how the oil splashed but burned my hand. I tried to let it cool down, but the pain was unbearable. I asked my friend to take me to the emergency department here. 
Doctor: So, this will be the workers' compensation for injury. 
Patient: I guess, yeah. 
Doctor: OK, let me see your hand. 
Patient: OK. 
Doctor: The burn is from the elbow to the wrist. It is mainly on the medial aspect. 
Doctor: OK, don't worry. We will take care of you.
