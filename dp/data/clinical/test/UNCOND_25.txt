Doctor: Are you keeping up with your food journal? 
Patient: Yes, and I have it with me today. 
Doctor: Good, and you're using calorie points, correct? 
Patient: Yes, I range from twenty six to thirty. 
Doctor: Good, are you exercising regularly?
Patient: Yes, I am. I'm also going to Overeaters Anonymous. 
Doctor: How is that going? 
Patient: Good, my sponsor is helping me, and told me to think about snacks that can help with my high blood sugar. That was what we talked about last. 
Doctor: Good, all of that is good to hear. 
Patient: I'm feeling a lot better, and I've lost weight, but do you have any information on diabetic exchanges, doctor?
