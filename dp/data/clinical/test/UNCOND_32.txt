Doctor: Tell me a little more about your family. Are there any significant conditions that your parents or siblings had that you know of?
Patient: Um, my dad died a few years back. He had color cancer and thyroid cancer. 
Doctor: I'm so sorry to hear that, sir. How old was he? 
Patient: Thank you, he was only fifty two. 
Doctor: That's tragic, I'm sorry. What about your siblings?
Patient: I have seven total. One of my brothers died from stomach cancer when he was fifty three and another brother committed suicide. 
Doctor: I'm so sorry to hear that. Can I assume your other siblings are healthy?
Patient: Yes sir, they're all doing very well. 
Doctor: That's good. Do you have any other conditions, like heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney disease? 
Patient: Nope, I keep pretty healthy.
