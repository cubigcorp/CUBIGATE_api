Doctor: Hello, miss. How are you doing today? 
Patient: My skin has been going crazy. 
Doctor: Could you describe to me what's happening? 
Patient: I can't really describe it, but I can show you. Here's a report from my local doctor. 
Doctor: I see. It says you have hay fever, eczema, sinus problems, and hives, correct? 
Patient: Yeah, I guess so. 
Doctor: Does this run in your family? 
Patient: Uhm. I don't think so. I know my mom has some type of cancer in her mouth. 
Doctor: I see. Have you been screened for cancer before? 
Patient: Oh, yeah. Here's the report with all that information. 
Doctor: This looks good. It says you don't have melanoma or skin cancers or psoriasis. 
Patient: Sounds good to me. So, what's all this stuff on my skin? 
Doctor: Hm. Let me take a look. Have you been sunburned before? 
Patient: Oh, yeah. I had some and it burned a lot. 
Doctor: I see. Are you currently taking any medications? 
Patient: It's on the report from my local doctor. 
Doctor: Looks like you're taking benzoyl peroxide and Daypro. You're not smoking with these medications, right? 
Patient: Do I look like I smoke? I've never smoked in my life.
