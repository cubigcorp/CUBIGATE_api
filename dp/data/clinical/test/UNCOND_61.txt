Doctor: So, ma'am, what brings you in for a visit today? 
Patient: Well, a few things, I have hay fever, um, eczema, sinus problems, and hives. 
Doctor: Wow, that's quite a lot. Do you have any history of melanoma, or skin cancer? 
Patient: No, just the eczema. 
Doctor: How about psoriasis? 
Patient: No, that doesn't ring any bells. 
Doctor: Do you have any family history of cancer? 
Patient: Um, yes, my mother had mouth cancer. 
Doctor: I see, do you smoke tobacco? 
Patient: Um, no, that never appealed to me, especially with the history of cancer. 
Doctor: Can I safely assume that you've been sunburned before? 
Patient: Sure, it happens when I go to the beach all the time. 
Doctor: What medicines are you taking right now? 
Patient: Um, I'm taking benzoyl peroxide and Daypro. Sorry I forgot to bring the blood test today.
