Doctor: Have you ever had surgery?  
Patient: One too many times. 
Doctor: Which ones? 
Patient: I had my appendix taken out and glaucoma surgery fairly recently. I also had my gallbladder taken out ten years ago and a partial colon resection due to colon cancer in nineteen sixty one. 
Doctor: Any recurring episodes of colon cancer? 
Patient: No, thankfully.
