Doctor: Okay, so let's go over the plan again. I'd like you to apply Acticoat dressing daily and make sure you're spending at least eight hours out of the chair for pressure relief. Any questions? 
Patient: That sounds doable. I'll try my best. No questions about the plan.
Doctor: I'd also like you to come back in a week for a reevaluation. 
Patient: Can I make that appointment today? 
Doctor: Yes, the receptionist will be able to get you on the schedule for next week. 
Patient: Great.
