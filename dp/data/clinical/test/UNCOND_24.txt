Doctor: Hello, ma'am. How are you doing today? 
Patient: My right hand hurts. 
Doctor: Is that your dominant hand? 
Patient: It is. 
Doctor: I see. What seems to be the problem? 
Patient: I feel like my right thumb just locks up, and I can't move it anymore. 
Doctor: Does it stay locked? 
Patient: No, it doesn't. It just moves out of nowhere. Like right now! 
Doctor: I can see that. Have you seen someone about your thumb before? 
Patient: I have. These are the notes from that visit. Here you go. 
Doctor: Thank you. It looks liked you were diagnoses with stenosing tendinosis, which is trigger finger. 
Patient: Is that common for a fifty one year old woman like me? 
Doctor: Yeah, it is. We can proceed by releasing the A one pulley? 
Patient: Could you describe what that means? Could you also go over the risks and benefits of the surgery?
Doctor: Of course. I'll explain it and give it to you in writing. 
Patient: Thank you. I'll most likely agree to it. I need to fix this thumb.
