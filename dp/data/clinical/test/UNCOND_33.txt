Doctor: I have sent over your referral for physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy. The patient coordinator at Siskin Rehab Hospital will give you a call within two days to see up your appointments. It is important to take your medications regularly. You need to continue the Cipro for an additional two days only. That will take care of the U T I. Do you have any questions? 
Patient: No.
