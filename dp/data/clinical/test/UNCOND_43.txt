Doctor: Hello, sir. What brought you in today? 
Patient: Do you not see the swelling on my right hand and arm? I'm white. The swelling should be noticeable!
Doctor: Oh, wow! How did this happen? 
Patient: I got stung by this huge Yellow Jacket Wasp yesterday. I usually see Doctor X Y Z, but he wasn't available. 
Doctor: I see. Have you ever been stung by a wasp before? 
Patient: Oh, yeah. Plenty of times. I'm twenty nine right now. I've been getting stung since I was in my early twenties. I usually just swell up like I am right now. 
Doctor: That's good. You never had any severe reactions before? 
Patient: I did one time before, which is why I came here early to get it checked out. 
Doctor: I see. Just a lot of swelling, correct? What about any anaphylaxis type reactions? 
Patient: What type of reaction? I don't know what that means, but you're right about the swelling. 
Doctor: It's a reaction that occurs that makes your body go into shock and lowers your blood pressure. 
Patient: Oh, I get you. No, I've never experienced that before. 
Doctor: Great. Have you ever felt a shortness of breath or your throat closing up before?
Patient: Nope. That would be really scary though. 
Doctor: Sounds good. Have you ever felt anxious or a fast heart beat after you've been stung? 
Patient: No, I haven't. I've only had swelling in the areas I've been stung.
