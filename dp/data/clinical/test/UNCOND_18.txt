Doctor: What brings you here today, sir?
Patient: I'm feeling a lot of lightheadedness and I just cannot keep stable. I'm losing my balance all the time.
Doctor: Do you have any spinning sensation?
Patient: No, but I had it before when I had vertigo. I'm just feeling lightheaded.
Doctor: Is it happening after anything special you are doing? What symptoms are you witnessing?
Patient:  Whenever I'm trying to change my positions like standing from sitting or getting up from the bed it is happening. Normally sitting back down helps. But it is not completely gone for like fifteen to thirty minutes. I feel very shaky and weak.
Doctor: Are you taking any medications for that?
Patient: Ah yes, I was taking lorazepam, but it did not help with the sensation.
Doctor: Anything else going on?
Patient: Um, my blood pressure was up so they increased my dose of metoprolol for it. They think all these symptoms are because of the increased dose. I just wanted to check in with you as well.
