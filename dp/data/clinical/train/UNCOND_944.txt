Doctor: Good morning, ma'am. My nurses tell me that you're thirty nine years old, is that correct? 
Patient: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that's correct. 
Doctor: So, what seems to be the problem today, ma'am?
Patient: I hurt my knee while on the trampoline back in late August. 
Doctor: Do you remember the mechanism of injury to this knee? 
Patient: What do you mean? 
Doctor: Well, was it a twisting, pulling, snapping kind of injury?
Patient: Oh, I twisted my knee. 
Doctor: Okay, have you seen another doctor for this?
Patient: Yeah, and I got an M R I. 
Doctor: Can I see the report?
Patient: Yes, here you go. 
Doctor: This M R I shows an A C L tear. Do you have any instability in this knee?
Patient: Yeah, I feel like my knee joint has been unstable for years. 
Doctor: Have there been any dislocations? 
Patient: Yeah, there have been. What can be done about this?
Doctor: Well, there's surgery to fix this. I can repair that A C L.  
Patient: What are the risks of infection with the procedure?
Doctor: Historically, it's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. 
Patient: Will I go under for this?
Doctor: Yes, you won't feel a thing. 
Patient: Okay, yes, I'd like the surgery done.
