Doctor: Hello. How are you doing today?
Patient: My head has been hurting a lot. 
Doctor: I see. Did the nurse come in and ask you questions about past medical history?
Guest_clinician: Sorry, Doctor. I was looking for you. I reviewed his history with him, and nothing has changed. 
Doctor: Perfect. Let's do some tests to see why your head has been hurting.
Patient: I'm ready for less pain. Let's go.
