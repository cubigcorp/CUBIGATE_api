Doctor: Good morning, young man. Are these your parents?
Patient: Yes. 
Doctor: Good, can you tell me more about your son, please? 
Guest_family_1: Well, he's five now, and he fell onto his right arm on December fifth two thousand seven.
Doctor: After he fell, how was he treated? 
Guest_family_1: We went to the E D right after he fell, and they said he had complete fractures of both bones in the arm. 
Doctor: Yes, I see that here, he also has shortening bayonet apposition. 
Guest_family_1: What can we do for this? 
Doctor: There's actually a few options here. First we can cast it and see how he heals, generally, children heal up very well from fractures. 
Guest_family_1: That's good, we like that option more than any kind of surgery. 
Doctor: However, surgery is also an option here as well. 
Guest_family_1: Yeah, to be completely sure we fix this, I think we should opt for the surgery, what do you think, honey?
Guest_family_2: Yes, I agree. What are the risks of infection for this surgery?
Doctor: The risk of infection is very low, generally less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. 
Guest_family_1: Will he be asleep for the surgery?
Doctor: Absolutely, he won't feel a thing. Other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, and need for later hardware removal, and cast tightness. I would not worry about these risks. We have great results with these surgeries. 
Guest_family_1: Then yes, we'd like to do the surgery.
