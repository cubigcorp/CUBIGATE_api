Doctor: How's this little guy doing today? 
Guest_family: I think he might have another ear infection.  
Doctor: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Let's have a look see.  
Guest_family: He's been telling me over and over again that his left ear is hurting him. He was here on April fourteenth and prescribed Amoxicillin.  
Doctor: Did that seem to help? 
Guest_family: It did at first, but the pain is back again. 
Doctor: Has he been running any fevers? 
Guest_family: No, no fevers. 
Doctor: He sounds a bit congested. 
Guest_family: He is. When he blows his nose, he brings up really thick mucous. This never really went away even with antibiotics. He's also been coughing a fair amount. 
Doctor: Is his cough productive? 
Guest_family: Yeah.  
Doctor: Does it seem to be keeping him up at night? How does the mucous look?
Guest_family: No, I don't think so. It is pretty thick and viscous. The cough isn't constant or anything. 
Doctor: And no shortness of breath or wheezing that you've noticed? 
Guest_family: No.
