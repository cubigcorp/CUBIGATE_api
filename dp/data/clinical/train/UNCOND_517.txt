Doctor: Good afternoon, ma'am. You're forty one years old, correct? 
Patient: Good afternoon, doctor. Yes, that's correct. 
Doctor: Thank you, have you followed up with Doctor X since your surgery? 
Patient: Why would I do that? 
Doctor: Oh, just because she referred you to me. 
Patient: Oh, no, I haven't yet. 
Doctor: That's fine. Have you heard the details behind your surgery? 
Patient: I heard it once, but I can't remember anything. Can you remind me? 
Doctor: Well, you had a complicated case, but we did an anterior cervical discectomy, two level corpectomy, with a spinal decompression and fusion with fibular strut and machine allograft in your large cervical plate. 
Patient: Oh, that's a lot, doctor. 
Doctor: Yes, how are you doing today? 
Patient: Well, I've felt good for the last two days.
Doctor: Have you been able to move your arms and legs for the last few days?
Patient: Yeah, I can actually move all four. 
Doctor: Good, are you having any issues breathing? 
Patient: No, nothing of note there. 
Doctor: Okay, today, I think you'd be a good candidate for a halo vest placement. 
Patient: Yeah, doctor, I'm not going back to the O R. 
Doctor: Okay, we can do it here. 
Patient: Okay doctor, I'd like to do it here. 
Doctor: Let me get A B C to help me with this. Also, we're going to move you to S I C U room one. 
Patient: Can you tell me the details about what you're going to do? 
Doctor: Well, this is a P M T halo, I like this one better than the Bremer halo vest, and I'll use morphine and Versed.
Patient: Are you going to use anesthesia? 
Doctor: Yes, I have local anesthetic, it's xylocaine and epinephrine, um, it's somewhere between fifteen and twenty C C.
