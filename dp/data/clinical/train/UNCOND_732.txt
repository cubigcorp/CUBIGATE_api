Doctor: What brings you into the office today?   
Patient: I had a stroke about a month ago. The right side of my face is still not moving. 
Doctor: Is it only the right side of the face that is affected by paralysis? 
Patient: Yes. It has improved a little bit since I was in the hospital.  
Doctor: That is a good sign. It can take up to six months see how much movement you will regain.
