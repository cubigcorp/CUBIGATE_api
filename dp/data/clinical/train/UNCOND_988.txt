Doctor: Hello Miss Jane, how are you?
Patient: I am good, thank you for asking.
Doctor: So, tell me what brings you here?
Patient: I have so many issues and problems, where do I start?
Doctor: Start by telling the one troubling you the most. 
Patient: I have this pain in my toes on the right side and I also feel this numbness there.
Doctor: Okay and do you feel any tingling sensation? Or feeling like your leg is giving away?
Patient: Yes, I feel the tingling and sometimes. I feel like my leg has fallen asleep.
Doctor: Hm, tell me about your pain. Is it mild, moderate, or severe?
Patient: Well, I will say it's moderate. 
Doctor: Would you define it as sharp shooting pain or dull kind of radiating pain? 
Patient: Maybe sharp pain but I am not sure how to describe it. But it radiates up the leg.
Doctor: Okay. How long have you had this problem?
Patient: It's been there for almost one year but now it started to get worst. 
Doctor: I see, does it get worse when you walk?
Patient: No, mostly when I am in bed. And sometimes I feel it on my left toe as well.
Doctor: It looks like you have paresthesia in the toes of your right foot and I feel your left toe also has the same problem.
Patient: Yeah, I thought so. I read over the internet. But anyways, I am also having this shoulder pain on both sides, plus I am not able to sleep at night.
Patient: I have high blood pressure and hypothyroidism. 
Doctor: Well-
Patient: Well, that's not it. I have thrombo-
Doctor: Thrombocythemia.
Patient: Yeah, that. 
Doctor: How are your allergies by the way?
Patient: I have no sinus allergies, thankfully.
