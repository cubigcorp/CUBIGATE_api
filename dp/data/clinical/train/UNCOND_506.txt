Doctor: So, looks like you have stones in your C B D. I am not hundred percent sure but most likely its stones. 
Patient: C B D? 
Doctor: Yeah, short for common bile duct. It's a small tube like structure which connects your liver duct and gallbladder. 
Patient: Oh! 
Doctor: Yeah, and because of that you have inflammation in your gallbladder.
Patient: Oh, I see.
