Doctor: How're your other children doing? 
Guest_family: Not so wonderful. They're all on antibiotics. 
Doctor: For the same? 
Guest_family: Yep. They all have ear infections and chest colds. 
Doctor: Your hands are full then. 
Guest_family: Tell me about it, doctor. I can't seem to catch much of a break. 
Doctor: It's definitely been a tough winter for you and your family.
