Doctor: Good morning, young man. You're a patient of Doctor X Y Z, correct? 
Patient: Yes sir, that's right. I've seen him for years. 
Doctor: I just need to confirm some demographic information before we get started today. So, you're a twenty nine year old white male, correct? 
Patient: Yes, doctor. That's all right. 
Doctor: Great, thank you. So, what seems to be the problem today?
Patient: Well, I got stung by a Yellow Jacket Wasp yesterday. 
Doctor: Do you have a lot of swelling? 
Patient: Yes, it's in my right hand and right arm. 
Doctor: Have you every been stung by wasps before?
Patient: Yeah, this wouldn't be the first time. 
Doctor: Have you had similar reactions before? 
Patient: Yeah, I have. I have had one severe reaction. I came because I wanted to make sure it didn't get to that point again. I've never had, um, anaphylaxis, nothing super serious to date. 
Doctor: Okay, that's good. Do you have any shortness of breath or difficulty with your throat?
Patient: No, it's never felt like it was going to close up or anything like that. 
Doctor: Do you have any rapid heartbeat or anxiety?
Patient: No, I don't have anything like that either. 
Doctor: So, it's just the localized swelling where you got stung?
Patient: Yes, that's really all, doctor.
