Doctor: Hello. How are you doing today? 
Patient: I want to get surgery on my leg. 
Doctor: Have you ever had a surgery. 
Patient: I did. Here's a list of them. 
Doctor: Looks like you had eye surgery, cataract surgery, and lumbar decompression, correct? 
Patient: Yeah. So, what options do I have for surgery? 
Doctor: I need to see what the problem is first.
