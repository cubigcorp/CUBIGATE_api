Doctor: So, how are long have you had pain in this hip? 
Patient: It's been about eight or ten years now. It began while I was working in construction. 
Doctor: How old are you now? 
Patient: I'm thirty two now, so I've been in pain since I was in my twenties. 
Doctor: Have you seen another doctor for this, or am I the first? 
Patient: Yeah, um, I've actually seen several doctors before, the last I saw was Doctor A B C a few weeks ago.
Doctor: What did those doctors tell you?
Patient: They thought it was low back pain, and something called, um, radiculopathy. 
Doctor: Does your pain radiate into your legs? 
Patient: Yes. 
Doctor:  Has your pain been present for the eight years, or did it come and go? 
Patient: It's been persistent, and I've had difficulties on and off since then. 
Doctor: Okay. The x rays from Doctor A B C show severe degenerative changes as well as avascular necrosis of the femoral head. What else did the Doctor do for you? 
Patient: He gave me some pain medicine, and we talked about going to another specialist for surgery.
Doctor: Do you remember the names of the procedures suggested? 
Patient: Something about resurfacing the hip, or a hip replacement. I'm here for another opinion on that. 
Doctor: I saw you come in with a cane, do you have groin pain as well?    
Patient: Yes, and I can't do any of the activities I used to. 
Doctor: Besides the pain medication, have you had anything else? 
Patient: I've taken antibiotic steroids before. 
Doctor: Okay. Do you drink? 
Patient: Yes, a lot.
