Doctor: We were not able to find the cause of your pain right now, but in the future, we will do a few more tests and then we can have a diagnosis.
Patient: Will you give me some medicine for my stomach pain? And what about that feeling to throw up all of the time?
Doctor: Yes, I will write a prescription. It will help you both with your pain and nausea.
