Doctor: Any past medical problems I should know of?
Patient: No, ma'am. I am forty three and this is the first time I have had a major issue. It's only been this past month where I've felt weaker than usual. I'm much more tired and short of breath whenever I move around.  
Doctor: Any recent weight loss? 
Patient: Yeah, I actually lost about fifteen pounds in less than two or three months. 
Doctor: How's your appetite? Any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea? 
Patient: Appetite is pretty fine. No nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
Doctor: How about fever, chills, sweats, cough? 
Patient: No, ma'am. 
Doctor: And any chest pain with your shortness of breath? 
Patient: No, ma'am.
