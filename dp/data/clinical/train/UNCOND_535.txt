Doctor: Hello, miss. How can I help you today? The nurse said the matter was urgent. 
Patient: Yes, I have been having dizzy spells. I have also noticed a new rash on my right calf. 
Doctor: Can you describe what type of dizzy spells you are having? What do they feel like?
Patient: It is general dizziness and vertigo. I am also lightheaded during the spells. 
Doctor: Are you feeling okay right now or are you experiencing symptoms?
Patient: I am having headaches off and on randomly, but nothing right now. The neck pain and muscle aches also are intermittent. 
Doctor: Let me take a look at the rash on your legs. Are the bruises new?
Patient: They are new, I think. I have noticed them more than usual. 
Doctor: In the past couple days have you had a fever or chills?
Patient: No, nothing like that. 
Doctor: What about chest pains?
Patient: I have had some tightness in my chest, but not right now. 
Doctor: Does the dizziness make you nauseous?
Patient: Yes, but I have not had to throw up or anything. 
Doctor: What about diarrhea?
Patient: No, thank goodness. 
Doctor: Are there any parts of your body that are hurting?
Patient: I do have some left shoulder pain. Not so much painful, but it is uncomfortable and tender. 
Doctor: Have you measured your blood sugar at all? I ask because the notes state there is a history of gestational diabetes and when blood sugars are out of the normal limits this can cause some of the symptoms you are having. 
Patient: I measured it today. After lunch it was one fifty five.
