Doctor: How are you doing today, sir? 
Patient: Honestly, I'm pretty sick today. I've got a lot going on. 
Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?
Patient: Well, it's been off and on for about a month now. 
Doctor: Has it been getting worse recently? 
Patient: Yeah, it has over the last couple weeks. 
Doctor: What are your symptoms? 
Patient: Well, I'm coughing up this yellow phlegm. It feels like everything is in my chest. 
Doctor: What medications have you been taking for this?
Patient: I've been taking Allegra D sometimes, but I'm almost out. I need a refill. 
Doctor: What other problems are you having? 
Patient: My foot keeps breaking out. 
Doctor: Has this improved at all? 
Patient: Well, it was for a while, but now it's really bad again. 
Doctor: Have you been diagnosed with any conditions before? 
Patient: I had, um, tinea pedis before. 
Doctor: How was this treated?
Patient: They gave me Nizoral cream.
Doctor: It has been getting warmer recently, I don't think that this isn't necessarily a coincidence that you're having these symptoms now.
Patient: Yeah, I work in the flint and it's really hot and humid down there.  
Doctor: What else are you dealing with, sir? 
Patient: I have this wart on my right middle finger, are you able to freeze it off? 
Doctor: Have you ever done that before? 
Patient: Yeah, you have done it before, and it went away. 
Doctor: If we've done it before, we can do it again. 
Patient: Cool, can we do blood work, too? I want to check on my prostate. 
Doctor: Well, that's called P S A. 
Patient: Can I have that done? I'm concerned. I am fifty after all. 
Doctor: Sure, we can check your cholesterol too. I know you have history of it being high. 
Patient: You know, I've been working on that. I quit smoking for a while, but I got back into it. 
Doctor: That's good, it's really hard to quit. 
Patient: Yeah, I tried chewing tobacco, but it's not the same. 
Doctor: Be sure to keep trying to quit smoking.
