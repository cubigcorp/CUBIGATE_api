Doctor: How old are you, sir? 
Patient: I'm sixty five years old. 
Doctor: Are you right handed or left handed? 
Patient: I'm right handed. 
Doctor: When was your last stroke? 
Patient: Well, it was on January seventeenth. I had these episodes where I was like always so confused and looks like I lost everything. All my memory and everything. And then they did a scan. It was verified that I was having a stroke on the same day. 
Doctor: Did they put you on some medications? 
Patient: They gave me an anticonvulsant and aspirin. 
Doctor: Are you taking them regularly? 
Patient: There have a few times like one or two days that I forgot to take my, uh, dyphenhydramine, but even when I'm taking it regularly, I'm still having all those symptoms or forgetfulness, confusion, and everything. 
Doctor: Do you feel anything else along with these episodes like a urine urgency, tendency to bite your tongue, headaches, any visual change, or your heart is beating very fast? Any kind of weakness or numbness or shortness of breath? 
Patient: No nothing else, just the confusion and forgetfulness. 
Doctor: How frequent are these episodes? 
Patient: Well, they occur like two or three times in a week. Each one of the episodes lasts for like one or two minutes.
