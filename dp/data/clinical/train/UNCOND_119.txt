Doctor: Can you confirm your age for me, ma'am?
Patient: Absolutely, I'm sixty six now. 
Doctor: Good, so it's been about five months since you last evaluation for type two diabetes and high blood pressure. 
Patient: Yes, and I have a few other problems today, too. 
Doctor: Sure, we can treat all of them. What seems to be the problem today? 
Patient: I'm having some right shoulder pain. 
Doctor: Can you remember an injury to this shoulder? 
Patient: No, not that I can remember. 
Doctor: What aggravates your symptoms? 
Patient: It hurts when I move the shoulder. 
Doctor: Do you have any weakness, numbness, or tingling? 
Patient: No, I don't have any of that. 
Doctor: Okay, back to diabetes, how has that been progressing? 
Patient: Well, I can only check it in the morning, and it's usually less than one hundred. 
Doctor: Have you been checking your blood sugar two hours after meals? 
Patient: No, doctor, I haven't been. When I check them, it's normal though. 
Doctor: Do you have any records to prove that? 
Patient: No, I don't have that with me today. 
Doctor: That's important, do you have any other issues or concerns today? 
Patient: No, I can't think of anything. 
Doctor: Okay. I'm looking at your charts, and I see you had a benign breast biopsy done on June eleventh two thousand four. Did you have a repeat done after six months like they asked? 
Patient: No, I never had that done, I need to.
