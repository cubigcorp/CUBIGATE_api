Doctor: How old are you? What brings you here today? 
Patient: I am fifty six years old. I am here for this pain in my legs. It hurts mostly in the night. 
Doctor: Does changing positions helps you? 
Patient: Yeah, it helps. Whenever I stand it just goes away. 
Doctor: Is it only in your legs or it starts there and goes somewhere else as well? 
Patient: It normally starts in my hips and then it goes down my leg and sometimes into my ankles as well. 
Doctor: When did you first notice it? 
Patient: It all started after taking that medication. What is it called? Something with L? Yeah, Lipitor. 
Doctor: Have you ever noticed any night sweats? 
Patient: Sometimes I do sweat at night. 
Doctor: Any other issue? Anything else going on? Your body temperature is a little on the higher end. 
Patient: Yeah, I do feel feverish and have nausea as well. 
Doctor: How are your sugar numbers? 
Patient: They have been low for quite some time. You know, I have started going to Genesis in Wichita and I've been doing water aerobics. And you know what? Surprisingly, I have lost thirty pounds. 
Doctor: That's good. How much is your fasting sugar? 
Patient: Anywhere between a hundred to one hundred and twenty. I check them one and a half hours after meals as well. They are, they have been one hundred and eighty five regularly. 
Doctor: Okay. 
Patient: Yeah. I have a request to make. I will be coming for my diabetic checkup in one month. Can we do all the labs before that? 
Doctor: Yeah, sure, that's a great idea. I should tell my assistant and they will call you for labs before your appointment for diabetes checkup. 
Doctor: Anything else going on? How is everything else? 
Patient: I tried to control my cholesterol with diet, but it didn't help. I cannot keep on dieting. It is just not my thing. I have started eating more meat though. I feel full after that.
