Doctor: Alright, I am looking at your urine report and it confirms what I was suspecting. You have a urinary tract infection.
Patient: I kind of knew it was a U T I. I have had it before, but nothing this painful and severe. I feel like I am going to die!
Doctor: Oh yes, it is because you got something called as acute cystitis and its usually very painful and can cause some serious complications. 
Patient: Well, is it because of my diabetes?
Doctor: I am afraid I don't have better news for you, but your diabetes is out of control. It's way too high and you must be really careful. Are you taking your medicines?
Patient: Yes!
Doctor: How bout diet?
Patient: Yeah, sometimes I don't care about my diet.
Doctor: Well, you must watch your diet, you can't just be careless. I am going to change your diabetes medication. And let's start you on the antibiotic that should give you relief. Also stay hydrated drink plenty of fluids it will help you flush the infection out.
Patient: Alright, thank you!
Doctor: Take care.
