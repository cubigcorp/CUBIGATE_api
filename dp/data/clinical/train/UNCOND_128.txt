Doctor: Are you a smoker? 
Patient: I used to smoke. I quit in nineteen sixty eight. 
Doctor: Excellent! Have you weighed your self recently? 
Patient: I weighed myself this morning. I am at one hundred and eighty three pounds. 
Doctor:  And how tall are you? 
Patient: I used to be five foot ten but I think I have been shrinking. 
Doctor: That is definitely a possibility. We do shrink as we go through life. I can have the nurse get your height after we do your exam. 
Patient: Okay.
