Doctor: Hello Miss Sherry, how are you doing today?
Patient: I have seen worse days. 
Doctor: Ha, I will take that as a positive answer then. I have my resident here with me, Doctor Helm, she will be representing your case today.
Guest_clinician: Hello.
Patient: Hello Doctor Helm.
Doctor: Doctor Helm. 
Guest_clinician: The patient is a sixty one year old female. She was diagnosed with non small cell lung cancer stage one A in the upper right lobe. She was treated with CyberKnife and the treatment was completed one month ago. This is her first visit after the CyberKnife treatment.
Doctor: Thank you Doctor Helm. So, Miss Sherry, how are you doing after the treatment?
Patient: I feel nauseous. 
Doctor: How would you define it mild, moderate, or severe? 
Patient: I would say mild. 
Doctor: What about vomiting?
Patient: No, only nausea is there. If I try to take deep breaths, then I still have pain. 
Doctor: How is your dysphagia? Are you able to swallow and eat your food and drink now?
Patient: It has been better now. I won't say I am all good but as I said I have seen the worst days. 
Doctor: Is there any heartburn or rash?
Patient: No.
Doctor: Are you coughing up blood, or just cough?
Patient: No, none of them. 
Doctor: Let me exam for any rib pain, okay?
Patient: Okay. 
Doctor: Any pain if I touch you here or here?
Patient: No.
