Doctor: How are you doing with everything?
Patient: I'm good. It's hard when you are in quarantine. I hope things will get back to normal soon. 
Doctor: So, you are here for your breast examination. 
Patient: Yes, it was due for so long. 
Doctor: I'm going to touch both of your breasts one by one to check for any lump or kind of mass. Okay?
Patient: Yeah. 
Doctor: Okay, so both looks good. Are you feeling any pain while I'm touching?
Patient: No, I don't feel any pain. 
Doctor: That's good, no masses, no pain and I do not feel anything in your armpit area.
