Doctor: Good morning, ma'am, welcome in. I believe this is our first time meeting. 
Patient: Good morning, doctor. Yes, this is my first time in. 
Doctor: Great, how old are you? 
Patient: I'm fifty five, doctor. 
Doctor: Thank you, what seems to be the problem today? 
Patient: Well, I'm having a laundry list of symptoms coinciding with my allergies. 
Doctor: Like what, ma'am? 
Patient: Well, my sense of taste is diminished, dry mouth, um, acid reflux, and G I issues, and then I have asthma, and reactions to things like aerosols. 
Doctor: I see, do you have any food allergies? 
Patient: Um, I think.
