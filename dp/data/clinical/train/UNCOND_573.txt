Doctor: How are you, Mary? 
Patient: I am okay, I have got this ulcer on my right hip again. 
Doctor: Oh, is it like the one you got last time?
Patient: Pretty much.
Doctor: Oh, I remember that one. It took almost three treatment cycles to get resolved.
Patient: Yeah. They keep saying I have some hidden split in my spine still. 
Doctor: Yeah, it looks like you have residual spina bifida.
Patient: I am just so frustrated sitting in my wheelchair. I am spending around sixteen hours a day in this wheelchair. 
Doctor: I think, that is the reason you developed this pressure ulcer. It appears to be on the right trochanter area. In simple terms you have developed a pressure sore on the outer part of your hip. 
Patient: Yeah, I recently celebrated my thirtieth birthday just sitting in my wheelchair the whole day.
Doctor: Oh, I am sorry dear. So, how long since you have had this ulcer?
Patient: It's been several weeks, so I thought I should get it checked.
Doctor: Yeah, good thing you came. We need to treat it. Did you experience any chills or fever? 
Patient: No.
Doctor: Any other symptoms?
Patient: No.
