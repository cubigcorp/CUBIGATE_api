Doctor: Do you have any major medical conditions that I should know about, sir?
Patient: Maybe, I might. What exactly do you mean by that, doctor?
Doctor: Well, it's broad, but it could be anything from depression to high blood pressure, to cancer. 
Patient: Okay, that's what I thought. I have high blood pressure. 
Doctor: What about your mental health, is there anything of note there? 
Patient: Um, yeah, I have anxiety, too.
