Doctor: What brings you in today, miss? 
Patient: I haven't been feeling well since I went to the dentist. 
Doctor: When did you go to the dentist? 
Patient: It was in May last year. 
Doctor: What happened at the dentist? Also, sorry, but how old are you. 
Patient: It was after I left the dentist. I was driving home, and I got lightheaded. I was so lightheaded that I had to pull over. 
Doctor: How long did the episode last? 
Patient: About two to three minutes. 
Doctor: Is this the only time that this has happened? 
Patient: No. In November last year, I was in the middle of eating breakfast when I got dizzy. I was so dizzy that I was nauseous, and I threw up several times. I was so exhausted from the dizziness and throwing up that I went to my room and took a two hour nap. I felt better and back to normal after I woke up from my nap. 
Doctor: How long did the vertigo last? 
Patient: It lasted about two to three minutes. So, about the same amount of time.
Doctor: Have you had any other dizzy episodes? 
Patient: No I didn't but in January on the thirteenth my right arm went numb. It lasted for about four to five hours. 
Doctor: Are you left handed, or right? 
Patient: I am right handed.

Patient: No. 
Doctor: Have you had any continuing weakness other than the time in January?
Patient: No. 
Doctor: Have you experienced any headaches or visual changes?
Patient: No. 
Doctor: Any continuing vertigo or lightheadedness?
