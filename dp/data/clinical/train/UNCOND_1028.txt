Doctor: Have you been in any accident?
Patient: I have been a truck driver for some time but luckily have not been in any major auto accident. I had hit a moose once, where I bumped my head but do not remember getting hurt anywhere else. I had broken my ankle in the past. 
Doctor: Hm, I see here you mentioned to the nurse, that a car fell on your chest six years back?
Patient: Oh yes, I was repairing my car and it fell off the car jack stand and fell on my chest but fortunately I was not hurt.
