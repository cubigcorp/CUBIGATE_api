Doctor: Hello, sir. I see your last visit was on July two thousand and seven. What was the reason for that visit?  
Patient: My asthma was acting up, and it felt like I couldn't breathe. 
Doctor: Do you have a history of asthma? 
Patient: Not that I know of, but I know I always get this really bad cough where I cough up some nasty phlegm. 
Doctor: I see. I'm looking at your report and it says you have a history of pneumonia.
