Doctor: How're you doing? 
Patient: Good for the most part. I'm still pretty tired most days, but I'm trying to stay more active. I'm wondering if it has to do with my sugar levels? 
Doctor: Hm let's see. I'd like to check your glucose and lipid panels and get you back in here again.  
Patient: And oh I've noticed some blood in my stool. I'm not sure if it's related. 
Doctor: How long has that been going on? 
Patient: Maybe a week or so?  
Doctor: Are you having any other symptoms? Black or tarry stool? Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea? Lightheadedness?  
Patient: No, none of that.  
Doctor: I'd like to order a hemoccult then. It's going to check to see if you're still having blood in your stool. 
Patient: Can I do this at the blood work place? 
Doctor: Yes, they'll be able to help you and answer any additional questions you may have. 
Patient: Okay. I'll try to go in tomorrow. 
Doctor: Remember you need to fast for the lipid panel, so I'd recommend going in early tomorrow morning before eating breakfast. 
Patient: Okay, got it. 
Doctor: And before I send you on your way, have you been able to schedule your yearly mammogram? 
Patient: Oh shoot. I still need to do that. I'll call them tomorrow.
