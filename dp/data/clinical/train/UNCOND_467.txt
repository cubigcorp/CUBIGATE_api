Doctor: Do you take any- 
Patient: Meds? 
Doctor: Yes. 
Patient: I do. I take Allegra for seasonal allergies. I also take something that starts with a P. I'm blanking on the name. My other doctor prescribed it to me for exercise induced asthma. 
Doctor: Oh, do you mean Proventil? 
Patient: Yes, that's it! I keep that on hand in case my asthma gets outta control. 
Doctor: Is it up to date? 
Patient: You mean is it expired? No, I don't think so. It hasn't been long since I visited the pharmacy. 
Doctor: Good. I always like to advise my patients to check expiration dates.
