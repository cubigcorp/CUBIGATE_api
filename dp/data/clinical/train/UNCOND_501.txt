Patient: It's mostly on the left side.  
Doctor: When did it start? 
Patient: Um a few days ago. 
Doctor: How'd you describe the pain? 
Patient: Kinda dull. 
Doctor: Any other symptoms with the pain, such as shortness of breath? 
Patient: Not really, no. 
Doctor: How long does the pain usually last? 
Patient: For a few minutes. It comes and goes. 
Doctor: Have you taken anything for the pain? 
Patient: I've taken some Advil, but it doesn't seem to help. 
Doctor: Have you had similar pain in the past? 
Patient: No, I don't think so.  
Doctor: And you had surgery on your abdomen five days ago, correct?
