Doctor: Good morning, ma'am. Can you confirm your age for me? 
Patient: Well, doctor, I'm sixty six years old now. 
Doctor: Thank you, so, how is your knee doing today? Hope the osteoarthritis is getting better. 
Patient: It's so bad, doctor. 
Doctor: Have you had any improvement with the rest and antiinflammatories we've talked about before? 
Patient: No, they haven't helped at all. 
Doctor: I see, you'd be a good candidate for a knee replacement. 
Patient: What's the risk of infection from the surgery? 
Doctor: Historically, it's less than one percent, we use prophylactic antibiotics to control for infection the entire time. 
Patient: Great, and will I be asleep for this? 
Doctor: Yes, you won't feel a thing.
