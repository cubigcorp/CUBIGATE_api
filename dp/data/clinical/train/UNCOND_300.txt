Doctor: Good morning, can you tell me more about your son, ma'am. 
Guest_family: Sure, he's forty six, White, and he has Down syndrome.
Doctor: Great, thank you. Is he still having problems with his hypothyroidism and onychomycosis? 
Guest_family: Yes, that's correct doctor. 
Doctor: Has he remained complaint with his Lamisil? 
Guest_family: Yes, he's taken six weeks of it with no problems. 
Doctor: Good, so we'll do an A L T blood test today.
Guest_family: Why is that doctor? 
Doctor: Well, at his last appointment in April, he had an elevated T S H level. So, we should recheck that today. 
Guest_family: Yes, I remember that. 
Doctor: Has he been taking his Levothroid daily as well? 
Guest_family: Yes, he has, he doesn't like it, but I help him with it, and he eventually takes it. 
Doctor: Good, thanks for taking care of him, Mom.  
Guest_family: Oh, it's my job. 
Doctor: Does he take any other medications? 
Guest_family: He has some medicated eye drops for his cornea.
