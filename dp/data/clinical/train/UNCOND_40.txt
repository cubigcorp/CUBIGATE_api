Doctor: Good afternoon, sir. My nurse tells me you're twenty eight years old, is that correct? 
Patient: Good morning, doctor. Yes, that's correct. 
Doctor: So, what happened?
Patient: Well, I punched a wall about three days ago. 
Doctor: Which hand is it?
Patient: It's my right hand. 
Doctor: Is this your dominant hand?
Patient: Unfortunately, yes, it is. 
Doctor: Where does it hurt?
Patient: Um, it's right here on the outside of my hand. 
Doctor: What kind of treatments have you had?
Patient: I went to the E D, and they pushed some of the joints in my hand back, and they put me in a splint, so I've been wearing that ever since. 
Doctor: How is your pain today? 
Patient: Compared to when it started, it's much better today. 
Doctor: How would you describe your pain today?
Patient: Today, I'd say it's minimal pain.
Doctor: Good, do you have any numbness or tingling today?
Patient: No, thankfully not.
