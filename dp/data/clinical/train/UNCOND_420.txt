Doctor: Hi, there. How are you both doing? What brings you two to the Emergency Department?
Guest_family: Hi, Doctor. We're both doing fine. I brought my daughter in today because she's been feeling sick. 
Doctor: I see. Let me ask your daughter a few questions before we start. Hi, ma'am. I understand you feel sick. Before we begin I just want to confirm some information with you. Where is your primary residency? 
Patient: My mom can give you the address. I still live with her. 
Doctor: Thank you. One last question. Do you smoke? 
Patient: Nope. My Mother has forbidden smoking in her home.
