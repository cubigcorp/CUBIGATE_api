Doctor: When did you retire from your job? 
Patient: About eleven years ago. It's definitely been nice. I'm able to spend more time with my grandkids. 
Doctor: Aw, how many grandkids do you have? And do you live alone? 
Patient: I have four grandkids between the ages of two and eleven. I live in the county with my wife and dog. My wife and I've been together for thirty some years now. 
Doctor: That's so wonderful to hear.
