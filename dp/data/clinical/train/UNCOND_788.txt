Doctor: How old is the baby? 
Guest_family: He is twenty one months old. 
Doctor: What brings you here today?
Guest_family: I have concerns about his motor development. Many times he seems to have lazy eyes and sometimes I can notice his jaw quivering. 
Doctor: How was your pregnancy? 
Guest_family: I had no complications in my pregnancy with him. My labor was very spontaneous, and it was a normal delivery. 
Doctor: Is this the only child?
Guest_family: No, I have two more kids. 
Doctor: How much did he weigh at birth? 
Guest_family: He was around eight pounds and ten ounces. 
Doctor: Did you remember his milestones?
Guest_family: Yes, I have all of it written down for all of my three kids and I brought this with me. He sat on his own by seven months. He was able to stand by eleven months and crawled around sixteen months but he was not walking until eighteen months. 
Doctor: What issues are he facing right now? 
Guest_family: He falls a lot. He cannot walk properly. He is kind of in toeing on his left. He's able to feed himself properly. He also throws, um, he picks up the things and throws them. His upper body looks strong. 
Doctor: How about his speech? How many words do you think he knows? 
Guest_family: He knows more than twenty words for sure. 
Doctor: Is he able to speak two word phrases? 
Guest_family: Yes. He says things like ,”give me,” and, “come here.” 
Doctor: Any other unusual behavior that you noticed? Any seizures or just the quivering movement of the jaw? 
Guest_family: No, it was only this and we have noticed this since birth. I don't know if it is related but I did notice that his left eye deviates outside.
