Doctor: Can you tell me more about your family medical history, sir? How's your dad doing? 
Patient: Well, doctor, he passed away. He had mesothelioma.
Doctor: I'm so sorry to hear that, sir. How is your mother? 
Patient: It's okay, thank you. I lost her too. She had A L S. 
Doctor: I'm sorry, that must be so hard.
Patient: Yes, it is, but I manage.
