Doctor: Welcome back to the clinic. How are you feeling today? 
Patient: Thank you. I am doing better. 
Doctor: It looks like we are following up on your severe osteoarthritis in both knees. And you also have been experiencing some flexion contracture limitations. 
Patient: Um hum.
Doctor: How is your physical therapy going? 
Patient: It is going really well. She kicks my butt but it seems to be helping. Doing my exercises at home is really helping. 
Doctor: Were you not doing them in the beginning? 
Patient: No, I wasn't. She got on me to start doing them and I have definitely seen the difference. 
Doctor: Have you experienced any worsening of pain since you were last seen? 
Patient: Well, the right knee is worse than the left? It mostly hurts after physical therapy. 
Doctor: Can you describe what the pain feels like? 
Patient: It feels achy. 
Doctor: Is it a continuous pain, or? 
Patient: No. It is not all the time. Every once and a while. It feels stiff all the time. 
Doctor: Any weakness or instability? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: Any burning sensations associated with the pain? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: How long have you been dealing with this? 
Patient: Several months. 
Doctor: Have you had any trouble sleeping?  
Patient: No. When I sit down or lie down at night there's no pain.
Doctor: So, the pain is when you are weight bearing, right? 
Patient: Yeah. And it hurts when I move around. It makes it difficult to do things. 
Doctor: Have you noticed any pain with the cold weather change? 
Patient: No, I have not noticed anything. 
Doctor: I am just going to take a look here. 
Patient: Okay. 
Doctor: I don't see any swelling or redness. And I don't feel any warmth coming from the area. Have you noticed any of these symptoms? 
Patient: Nope. 
Doctor: Any radiating pain through the knees here? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: Any pain any where else in the body? 
Patient: No, just the knees. 
Doctor: So, no pain in the hips or back? 
Patient: Nope.
