Doctor: Well, I am looking at your test reports and your blood sugars have been running up and down but nothing to be worried about but yeah, we need to keep monitoring. This morning it was perhaps a bit high at one hundred eighty-eight. Last time it was one hundred fifty and in one report it's around one hundred twenty and in lower teens too which is good. So, tell me how are you feeling?
Patient: Well, I am doing okay. I am getting treated for hemorrhoids. I am also having some constipation from the past few weeks and I have recently developed this cough which is okay as I kind of get it often.
Doctor: Oh boy, that's a lot going on!
Patient: Yeah. 
Doctor: So, tell me are your hemorrhoids painful?
Patient: No, it's fine.
Doctor: And are you taking anything for constipation? 
Patient: Well, just prune juice.
Doctor: Okay, let me write you an order for a laxative that should help. How bout cough? Any pain in the ribs while coughing?
Patient: Nah, I am not bothered by it.
Doctor: Any headache or nerve pain or body pain?
Patient: Um, no I am fine.
Doctor: Any fall or imbalance problem?
Patient: No.
Doctor: Any agitation or any other issues? 
Patient: Well, I am doing okay! Sometimes if I have pain, I take Tylenol and usually it works for me.
Doctor: That's good!
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor: So, you have been seeking psychiatric help from Doctor Hudyncia right?
Patient: Yes.
Doctor: She mentioned in her report that you are responding well to her treatment and that your depression is under control and the medicine is working for you. That's good news. Oh, what medicine has she prescribed? Um let me see here in the report, oh okay, got it! It's Cymbalta. 
Patient: Right.
Doctor: And no side effects, right?
Patient: No.
Doctor: And looks like the plan is to treat you for a minimum one year. 
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor: Lastly, any breathing issues?
Patient: No.
