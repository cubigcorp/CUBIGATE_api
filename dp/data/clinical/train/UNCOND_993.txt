Doctor: How are you feeling? You have been sick?
Patient: Yes, I am not feeling well for the last three days.  I have bad body aches, cough and a sore throat.  
Doctor: Do you get wet cough or it's dry? What color sputum comes out?
Patient: It is wet and green colored stuff comes out.
Doctor: Okay we will need to send it out to culture, maybe an infection.
Doctor: How about fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea anything like that? Are you sleeping well?
Patient: Everything is fine except some chills? I am sleeping okay.
Doctor: Do you need anything for cough?
Patient: I don't need anything for the cough. I did call yesterday and got a refill of my Keflex. Then I took two Keflex this morning and I am feeling little bit better now. 
Doctor: Okay then why are you crying, ma'am?
Patient: I am just tired of feeling like ran down.
Doctor: I am so sorry.
Patient: Hm.
