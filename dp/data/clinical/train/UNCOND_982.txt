Doctor: Are you still having trouble with urination? 
Patient: It has gotten better but is still a little difficult. 
Doctor: Okay. It looks like Doctor X did an exam yesterday. Doctor X consulted me on your status but I have a question for you. I see in your medical history that you had a bruised left kidney. Can you tell me more about the bruised kidney? 
Patient:  Yes. I was in a car accident, years ago. The doctor told me that I had a bruised left kidney. They thought it was due to the accident, but they could not be certain.
