Doctor: Hello! What brings you back into the clinic today? 
Patient: I came back because I increased my methothrexate as we discussed the last time I was here. A few days later I started getting multiple canker sores in my mouth. They hurt. 
Doctor: I am sorry. It is likely that the increased dosage of your methothrexate is the cause of the mouth sores. Have you experienced a decreased appetite, nausea, abdominal discomfort or diarrhea?
Patient: No. It is painful to eat with the sores, but I still have an appetite. 
Doctor: Have you had any new rashes, or hair loss? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: I would like to get some bloodwork done. I would also recommend we decrease your dosage back to your previous amount. I would also like to see you back in two weeks to see how you are doing. 
Patient: Okay.
