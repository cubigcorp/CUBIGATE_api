Doctor: So, this is your follow up? How are you doing so far with Lamictal? 
Patient: Yes, it's the follow up. Lamictal was okay. There was no side effect with that. But I had twitching in my muscles a lot of times. It was not generalized, but I was very afraid that this will happen. 
Doctor: What time of day was it? That you had these episodes. 
Patient: Mostly in the mornings. 
Doctor: I have your recent E E G report. It did show multiple spikes and some complexes on both the sides, but it is more prominent on left.
Patient: I have been taking my medications very regularly and  I was getting a good amount of sleep as well. 
Doctor: Are you able to drive? 
Patient: Yes. 
Doctor: Is there any change in your social history or any other symptoms that arise or, or is it same as before? 
Patient: Looks same to me.
