Doctor: Did both your parents have heart complications.
Patient: Unfortunately, yes. My mom passed from a heart attack at seventy three and my father at eighty.
Doctor: I'm so sorry to hear that. 
Patient: I lost my brother as well. He passed away from a brain tumor when he was nine years old.
Doctor: I can't imagine how hard that must've been.
Patient: It was a dark time in our lives, but we survived it as a family.
