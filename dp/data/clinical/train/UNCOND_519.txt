Doctor: Welcome in, sir. 
Patient: Thank you. 
Doctor: Let us start off with a little background. 
Patient: Okay. 
Doctor: What is your current living status? Do you live with others or on your own? 
Patient: Well, right now I am living with my sister in Sacaton. I am currently looking for my own place, but I am staying with her for now. 
Doctor: Are you looking for a place in Sacaton? 
Patient: No. I will probably look for a place back in Coolidge. 
Doctor: Back in Coolidge? Have you lived there before? 
Patient: I recently separated from my wife. We lived in Coolidge together. Sacaton is too far away from everything, but it is fine for now. 
Doctor: I am so sorry to hear that. 
Patient: Thank you. My sister has been a saint. I am not working right now so my sister is letting me stay with her for free. She gave up her home office and made me a nice room to stay in. 
Doctor: Your sister is very generous. Are you and your sister close?
Patient: Not when we were growing up but now that we are older, we have become very close. She has been a great support for me in these hard times. 
Doctor: That's wonderful. Are you a tobacco user? 
Patient: I smoke cigarettes. I only smoke a little bit. 
Doctor: How much do you smoke per day? 
Patient: I only smoke about one or two cigarettes a day. 
Doctor: Do you or have you ever used drugs or alcohol? 
Patient: I have never used drugs. I used to be a heavy drinker. I quit drinking a year ago. 
Doctor: That's great. Do you attend A A meetings? 
Patient: No, but I might start. Things have been very stressful lately with the separation and being on unemployment. 
Doctor: I think it could be beneficial to you. 
Patient: Okay. 
Doctor: I have a list for different support groups in the area that I can give you. 
Patient: Great. Thank you.
