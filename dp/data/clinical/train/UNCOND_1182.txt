Doctor: So, what brings you in for a visit today? 
Patient: Well, I've been having some leg pain on the side of my legs. 
Doctor: How long have you had this pain? 
Patient: It's been several months at this point. 
Doctor: When is your pain the worst? 
Patient: Um, it's the worst at night, I have to take medicine for the pain. 
Doctor: What do you take? 
Guest_family: She takes Advil, Motrin, and Tylenol P M. 
Doctor: Wow, that's a lot. Looks like you have some patch sensory loss in the L four to S one region. Are you going to the bathroom regularly? 
Patient: Yeah, there's no problems there. I do have some loss of feeling in my big toe and calf though.
