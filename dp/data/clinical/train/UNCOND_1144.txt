Doctor: Hello, how are you doing? What brings you here? 
Patient: I think I have allergies. I used to live in Seattle. I had allergies there, but I think they're getting worse after moving here. You see, I'm twenty three and I am a white female. I was in Seattle, I thought that the weather there is not for me. That's why I plan to move on here, but my allergies are not leaving me here either. 
Doctor: What did you take for your allergies before? 
Patient: Claritin and Zyrtec. 
Doctor: How effective were they? 
Patient: They seemed to be working for some time, but now I feel like nothing is effective anymore. 
Doctor: Have you ever tried Allegra? 
Patient: Yes, I tried that last summer and I've started it again like two weeks ago. But again, the story is the same. They work for some time and now it doesn't seem to be working anymore. 
Doctor: Have you tried sprays? 
Patient: I did use some over the counter ones. But I never got any prescribed nasal spray. 
Doctor: Any other medically related history that I should be aware of? 
Patient: I do have asthma if that counts. 
Doctor: Are you taking any medications for your asthma? 
Patient: Nope, nothing on the regular basis. 
Doctor: Do you think it is your asthma that is flaring up? 
Patient: I don't think so. I think, I still think it is just some allergies. I want to get tested.
