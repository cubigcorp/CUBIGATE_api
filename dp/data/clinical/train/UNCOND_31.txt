Doctor: I understand that you are new to the clinic. Welcome. 
Patient: Yes, I am new here. I have lived in Arizona for the last four years. I am from Maine. That is where I grow up and most of my family still lives there.  
Doctor: What line of work are you in? 
Patient: I am a homemaker. I used to clean house, a while back.  
Doctor: Do you have children? 
Patient: I have two children but only one of them is still with us. My oldest son passed away from ulcerative colitis complications three years ago.  
Doctor: I am so sorry to hear that!
