Doctor: Hi there, how are you dear?
Patient: I am fine, thank you.
Guest_family: Hi Doctor, I am her mother.
Doctor: Nice to meet you. So I see you have been referred by Doctor X.
Guest_family: Yes, she is our family doctor.
Doctor: Okay, so you noticed some behavioral problems with your daughter and reported to her, is that right?
Guest_family: Yes, I have been noticing them for a while. She loses her focus quickly. We also got a few complaints from school regarding her behavior. We also met a couple of other doctors but they diagnosed her with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.
Doctor: Well, looking at her reports I am afraid it looks like she does have A D H D, but the good news is we can treat her, so don't worry.
Guest_family: Okay. 
Doctor: I am going to prescribe her some medicines which will help her deal with this.
Guest_family: Thank you. 
Doctor: So, I will write her a prescription for Adderall and Clonidine. They have some really good results in treating A D H D. Which pharmacy do you go to?
Guest_family: We go to Costco pharmacy by the X Y Z corner.
Doctor: Okay, I will send it there.
Patient: Thank you doctor, it was nice meeting you.
Doctor: Nice meeting you too, take care.
