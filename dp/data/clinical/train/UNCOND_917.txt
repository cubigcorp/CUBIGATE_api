Doctor: So it looks like you're here today for a noticeable foreign body sensation in your eye. 
Patient: Yeah, my left eye. Never had this happen to me in my forty one years.
Doctor: First time for everything I guess! When did you first notice the sensation? 
Patient: Um when I was at work this morning. It felt like something was in my eye. I went to the bathroom mirror to check it out, but didn't see anything. I flushed my eyes with water in hopes of it helping with the weird feeling.
Doctor: Okay. Hm, are you experiencing any eye pain, blurred vision, or sensitivity to light? 
Patient: The pain has definitely gotten worse since this morning. My vision is fine and bright lights don't seem to be a problem.
