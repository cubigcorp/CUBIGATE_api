Doctor: Good morning, ma'am. Can you confirm your age for me, please? 
Patient: Good morning, I'm sixty five years old, doctor. 
Doctor: How are you recovering from your operation? 
Patient: I'm doing okay. Can you remind me what operation I had? 
Doctor: Um, we did a left upper lobectomy for your stage I A non small cell lung cancer. 
Patient: Thank you, doctor. 
Doctor: Absolutely, do you have the results of your pelvic C T? 
Patient: Yes, I have the report right here. 
Doctor: Thank you, so this shows an enlarging simple cyst of the left kidney. 
Patient: What can we do about this? 
Doctor: Well, that's why we did the barium swallow, which showed a small hiatal hernia with minimal reflux. 
Patient: Oh, yeah, I remember that. 
Doctor: So, I have your x rays from November twenty third two thousand nine here, we did an A P and lateral view, and they're normal. 
Patient: Oh, well that's good too.  
Doctor: Are you having any pain with swallowing food? 
Patient: Yes, I get some chest pain, but I'd say it's pretty mild. Look at my calf, doctor, it's much bigger than the right one. 
Doctor: Chest pain is probably due to tertiary contractions with some delayed emptying. Is it tender? 
Patient: No, there's no real tenderness. 
Doctor: How long has this calf been enlarged? 
Patient: Um, it's been several months at this point. 
Doctor: Have you ever had D V T? 
Patient: Yes, um, in nineteen seventy five, and in nineteen eighty five. 
Doctor: Are you having any abnormal weight loss? 
Patient: No, everything is normal there, and I'm eating normally. 
Doctor: What about any cold or flu symptoms? Any fever or chills?  
Patient: No, that's all fine too. 
Doctor: Any new aches or pains? 
Patient: No, all my muscles feel pretty good. 
Doctor: Have you had a cough, or coughed up any blood. 
Patient: That's a negative, doctor. 
Doctor: What about shortness of breath while at rest or difficulty breathing with exercise? 
Patient: No, that's normal too. I'm breathing just fine.
