Doctor: How are you, sir? 
Patient: One less than sixty.
Doctor: So, what happened? 
Patient: I was visiting my son in Cheyenne, Wyoming, then I on October tenth when I was taking a shower, I felt a pop in my head. I don't know what happened after that. 
Guest_family: We thought he was having a long shower that day. Then about one and a half hours later my son suspected something is not right and we went up to check. There we found him unconscious on the shower floor. Our son, he then drove us back to Iowa and since then he is complaining of these headaches and that he's not feeling well. He gets unconscious or falls asleep I don't know but it is happening a lot of the time. We got him to local hospital today in the morning. It is three days after that shower incident. 
Doctor: Yeah, his report says he got a hemorrhage, I mean, blood clot in his brain. 
Guest_family: Yeah, after that report they transferred us to this hospital.
