Doctor: Okay, so let's go over your medications. I'd like you to take these to help your muscle spasms. 
Patient: Sounds good. 
Doctor: I've prescribed eight hundred milligrams of Ibuprofen to be taken every eight hours as needed along with Tylenol number three every six hours as needed. 
Patient: What does the number three stand for? 
Doctor: Tylenol number three is combined with Codeine. 
Patient: Okay, I see. 
Doctor: And finally, I'm prescribing Methocarbamol seven fifty milligrams which needs to be taken four times a day for maximum relief. Do you have any questions for me? 
Patient: No, I think you answered them all.
