Doctor: I see here that you've been feeling more short of breath. 
Patient: Yes, for three days now. 
Doctor: Is it worse when you exert yourself? 
Patient: Um no, not really. I've had a terrible cough along with frequent headaches and chest congestion. I have also had a low fever. 
Doctor: Did these symptoms start around the same time? 
Patient: I think so. 
Doctor: Where does your chest feel most congested? And how would you rate the pain right now? Ten being the worst.
Patient: Both sides. I'd say it's at a three currently.
Doctor: Does it send pain or numbness or tingling down your arms? How about any jaw pain as a result? 
Patient: No, but it does get worse whenever I cough. 
Doctor: Is this your first time experiencing this type of congestion? 
Patient: Oh no. I had something like it about ten months ago.  
Doctor: Did that improve on its own? 
Patient: It would come and go, but over the past few days it's gotten worse. I am a strong German man so I held out coming to the doctor as long as I could. 
Doctor: You are very strong! You are sixty nine though, so I don't think anyone would see it as weak if you came to the doctor more often.
