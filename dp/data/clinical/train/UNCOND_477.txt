Doctor: Hello, what brings you here today? 
Patient: I fell four times on third of this month because my leg suddenly gave out. 
Doctor: How old are you? 
Patient: You don't ask age of a lady. She will never tell you the truth. 
Doctor: I know I'm in the wrong profession. I have to do that every time I meet someone. So how old are you?
Patient: That's true. I'm just teasing you. I'm fifty one. 
Doctor: Are you right handed or left handed? 
Patient: I am right handed. 
Doctor: So, you said that your legs suddenly gave out. What happened exactly? Was it sudden? Or were you noticing some weakness before as well? 
Patient: Oh, I noticed weakness in my right leg before as well and sometimes, like, I have to give the support of my arm to actually move it. Sometimes during these episodes I just turn pale and it's like overall weakness. I feel so tired. My husband, he gives me some sugar, three teaspoons, and then it helps a little bit but not completely. 
Doctor: So, is your weakness like overall in your legs or it is at any single point? 
Patient: It's overall. I remember in one of these episodes I was, like, in an odd fisted posture. 
Doctor: Is there any change in your sensations? Like if I touch you, is it like same before or was there any change? 
Patient: No, nothing like that. 
Doctor: Is there change in vision? Are you seeing double? 
Patient: Nope. 
Doctor: Any difficulty in swallowing or eating? Any loss of consciousness?
Patient: Nope. 
Doctor: Any difficulty in speech? Slurring, or anything like that? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: You said that these episodes have been happening for some time, so did you see anyone for those before? 
Patient: Nope. It's just that I fall and then fell again last night. I was feeling so weak. Nothing was helping me. That's when, in the morning, my husband brought me to the U I H C hospital for the evaluation on the fifth.
