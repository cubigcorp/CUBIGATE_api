Doctor: Hello, sir. So, remind me, how long ago was your procedure? 
Patient: Let me think. Now, it's been about four months. I just turned fifty nine.
Doctor: Okay, and just to refresh your memory, we did a percutaneous screw fixation of a Schatzker I V tibial plateau fracture, and we've managed those toe fractures nonoperatively. 
Patient: Which toes did I break? 
Doctor: You broke your second and fifth toes.
Patient: Do you have the x rays? Can I see where the breaks are? 
Doctor: Absolutely, if you look here, right here is where the breaks are. These are called the metatarsal heads. 
Patient: Wow, that's right where it hurts. 
Doctor: Yep, and where are you living now? 
Patient: Thankfully, I left the nursing home, and I'm back in my own house now. 
Doctor: That's really good. Are you in any pain today?
Patient: No, not today. 
Doctor:  Great, have you been going to P T? 
Patient: Yeah, I've been going about two or three times a week. 
Doctor: Are there any signs of infection, like drainage from the incision?
Patient: Nope, the wound healed up nicely. I'll be able to wear shorts again. 
Doctor: Great, are you having any fever symptoms, like cough, runny nose, sore throat, fatigue, anything like that? 
Patient: No, but I have had some tingling in both my feet. I don't know if its related to surgery. If I'm remembering the names right, um, I have a history of spinal stenosis and neuropathy in my legs. 
Doctor: With your history of spinal stenosis, the broken toes, and the surgery, that's a pretty normal side effect.
