Patient: And do I have to restrict my movement or activities?
Doctor: Um, I have taken the plaster off and your foot looks good. I don't want you to restrict your activities, but you are the best judge of the situation. So, I will advise you to take it slow and do as much as you can tolerate. 
Patient: Got it. Thank you, Doctor. Do I need a follow-up?
Doctor: As long as you are doing fine, having no pain, I think we are okay. 
Patient: Alright then bye.
Doctor: Bye.
