Doctor: Let's talk about your family history. Did anyone in your family have any medical issues that you were aware of? 
Patient: I don't think so. My family has been pretty healthy. Both my parents died of old age. 
Doctor: What about your siblings? Any kind of thyroid issue or diabetes or blood pressure issue there? 
Patient: I have one older brother. He's into weightlifting and all. I would say he's pretty healthy.
