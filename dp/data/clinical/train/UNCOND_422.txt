Doctor: Hi. How are you doing, sir? 
Patient: Hi. I am doing fine. 
Doctor: The nurse told me that you are on disability from work now. What happened? 
Patient: I got hurt at work and now I am on disability. 
Doctor: What did you do for work? How long ago was your injury? 
Patient: I worked on the pipeline. The accident was five years ago.
Doctor: Which condition led to the disability? 
Patient: I don't know really. I sent in all the notes for my doctor for evaluation and they approved the disability. 
Doctor: Okay. Do you live alone or with family? 
Patient: I live with my wife. 
Doctor: Are you a smoke or have you ever been? 
Patient: I used to smoke. I quit years ago. 
Doctor: How long ago did you quit? 
Patient: Oh, about twenty years ago. 
Doctor: How many years did you smoke? And how much did you smoke?
Patient: Probably twenty years. I was up to two packs a day. I feel way better now. 
Doctor: That's great. Any use of alcohol or illicit drugs? 
Patient: Nope. 
Doctor: What do you do for fun? Do you have any hobbies? 
Patient: I don't really do much these days. Work was my hobby.
