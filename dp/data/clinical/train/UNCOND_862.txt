Doctor: Where do you feel the most pain? 
Patient: I'd have to say at the heels of my feet. I spend a lot of time on my feet at work. 
Doctor: I see. What kind of shoes do you normally wear to work? 
Patient: Regular tennis shoes. 
Doctor: Are they cushioned? 
Patient: Eh not really, but they're pretty durable. 
Doctor: I'd advise getting an orthotic for your shoes to help with the heel pain and resting your feet when you're home. In the meantime, I'd like for you to see a specialist to make sure nothing else is going on. 
Patient: Alright, I'm good with that plan. 
Doctor: Are you having any other problems? Joint pain, difficulty walking, nausea, vomiting, or other symptoms? 
Patient: No, just heel pain for now.
