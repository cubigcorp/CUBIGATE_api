Doctor: What brings you in today? Can you also please state your age?
Patient: Yeah. I am forty five. I've had really bad stomach pain on my right side since last week. 
Doctor: On a scale of one to ten, how bad is the pain at its worst? 
Patient: I'd have to say a seven. 
Doctor: How would you rate it now? 
Patient: Oh um it's at a five at the moment. 
Doctor: Have you been taking your diabetes medication? 
Patient: Micronase? 
Doctor: Yes. 
Patient: Yeah, I've been taking it every day. 
Doctor: Great. Okay, let's try to get to the bottom of this stomach pain.
