Doctor: Okay, let's talk about your family history. 
Patient: Oh, I have very disturbing family history! 
Doctor: Why do you say so?
Patient: Well, my mother passed away due to heart attack in her late sixties and my father had liver cancer and he passed away from that. 
Doctor: Oh-
Patient: Oh, that is not all. My one son suffers from hypothyroidism and my daughter's two kids have cerebral palsy from being born prematurely.
Doctor: Oh, that is so unfortunate.
Patient: Yeah.
