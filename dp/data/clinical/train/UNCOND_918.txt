Doctor: What brings you in today? 
Patient: I've had a lot of discomfort in my private area. 
Doctor: When did it start? 
Patient: It's been going on for about two weeks now. 
Doctor: Have you noticed any abnormal discharge? 
Patient: Not really, no. But it's been super itchy down there.  
Doctor: Any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting?  
Patient: Uh no, but I'm having some pain here. 
Doctor: Near your pelvis? 
Patient: Yeah. 
Doctor: Have you started any new lotions or products? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: Have you tried anything for the pain or itching? 
Patient: No, not yet. I thought it'd go away on it's own. 
Doctor: If it's okay with you, I'd like to do a pelvic exam. 
Patient: Fine with me. 
Doctor: Have you been sexually active prior to or after noticing these concerns? 
Patient: Uh once this past week, but it was pretty painful. 
Doctor: I see. You may have an infection, which is why I'd also like to send out samples to the lab. Did you use protection? 
Patient: Yeah, I take birth control. But I've been struggling a bit with my mood and I'm wondering if it's because of the new birth control pills. 
Doctor: We can look into that as well. Hang tight while I grab the nurse for the pelvic exam.
