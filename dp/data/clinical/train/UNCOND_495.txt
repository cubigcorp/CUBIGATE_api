Doctor: How was the procedure? 
Patient: It was okay. I was nervous to go under the knife at first, but it turned out better than I expected. Do you know others who've gotten hysterectomies that are near my age? 
Doctor: I do, actually. It's a pretty common procedure. I'm glad to hear that you didn't experience any complications. 
Patient: Me too.
