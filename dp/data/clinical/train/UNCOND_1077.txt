Doctor: How about any surgeries in the past?
Patient: Well, I had colon surgery in nineteen eighty nine or was it ninety, oh yeah in nineteen ninety. 
Doctor: Okay and anything else?
Patient: Ah yes, I had three surgeries for my sinus one was the same year as my colon surgery, one was before that. So, the first one was in nineteen eighty seven I believe then nineteen ninety and the last one was in two thousand five.
Doctor: Wow, you remember the years also. 
Patient: Yeah, surprisingly.
