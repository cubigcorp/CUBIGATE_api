Doctor: How are you feeling today, sir? 
Patient: I feel pretty weak right now, but I am doing okay at the moment. 
Doctor: I reviewed the chart notes that was sent to me by the nursing home. They also sent me your medical history. You have been going through a lot recently. 
Patient: Yes, I have. They moved me into the nursing home after I was released from the hospital. I hope that it is just temporary.
Doctor: I understand that you had a seizer and that is why you were taken to the hospital. 
Patient: I had multiple seizures. After I was stabilized from the last seizure this side of my body in not working right. 
Doctor: Okay so you are having some partial weakness on this side? 
Patient: Yes. That is why they moved me to the nursing home. I can't stand up. I am too weak. I can't take care of myself. The nurses have to help me do everything. 
Doctor: I am going to try to help you get back to doing things on your own. 
Patient: After being in the hospital I got an infection in my intestines. They put me on some antibiotic that I have never heard of and a probiotic.
Doctor: Okay. I see here in the chart that you had two surgeries on July sixth. 
Patient: Yes, and then I had a radiation treatment too. 
Doctor: Oh yes. On August seventh. 
Patient: That sounds right. 
Doctor: Your surgeries may have been the reason for the C diff. 
Patient: What is C diff?
Doctor: It is an infection in the large intestine. It is often caused by overuse of antibiotics, and you have been on them for a while due to the surgeries that you have had. Or it could be from the surgery itself. 
Patient: That make since.
