Patient: Help! I need help! I need to see the doctor! 
Doctor: Yes, what's wrong? Where's your pain? 
Patient: My stomach! It hurts so much! I've never had this type of pain before! 
Doctor: When did it start?  
Patient: At ten! I don't know. It started hurting out of nowhere. One second I'm driving home and the next thing I know I had to call- 
Doctor: Yes? 
Patient: The pain is so bad! It's hard for me to even think straight.
