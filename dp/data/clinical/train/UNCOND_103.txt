Doctor: Hi there! I have the results from your ultrasound. You have kidney stones in the ureter close to the bladder.
Patient: Oh no. 
Doctor: This explains the pain you have been having on your left side. Are you still experiencing nausea and vomiting? 
Patient: Yes, I have been. 
Doctor: I would like to set you up with a consult with a consult with a surgeon.
Patient: Okay.
