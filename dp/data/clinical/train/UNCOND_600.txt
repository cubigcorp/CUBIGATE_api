Doctor: Hello, sir. How are you doing today? 
Patient: I'm flustered. I brought my wife so she can speak for me. 
Doctor: Hello, ma'am. What seems to be the problem with your husband? 
Guest_family: He's been having some problems with his skin in his private region. He's too shy to talk about it himself.
