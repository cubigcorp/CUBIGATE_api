Doctor: Do you drink? 
Patient: No, doc. 
Doctor: How about smoke? 
Patient: That I do. 
Doctor: How long have you been smoking? 
Patient: I long time.
Doctor: Have you tried to quit or reduce how much you smoke? 
Patient: Truly, I have no interest in doing that with my age. 
Doctor: I see. I'd recommend you consider nicotine patches because smoking brings with it many health problems. 
Patient: Tell me something I don't know. 
Doctor: I understand. How about any other drug use? 
Patient: I know you're not going to like hearing this, but I'm big on weed. I know, I know, I'm going to regret all of this at some point in time. It's just become a habit that's incredibly hard to break.
Doctor: Okay. I'd rather you smoke weed than cigs. How many packs a year do you think you smoke on average?
Patient: I go through a pack around every two weeks. Let's go with around twenty seven.
