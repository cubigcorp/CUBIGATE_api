Doctor: Hi there! I am Doctor Sherman. 
Patient: Hello! It is nice to meet you. 
Doctor: It looks like your P C P sent you to us for a possible prostate problem. 
Patient: Yes. I am nervous. 
Doctor: Do not be nervous. We will start with discussing the symptoms you have been experiencing, a physical exam and then we will get a urine sample if you are able. 
Patient: Okay.
