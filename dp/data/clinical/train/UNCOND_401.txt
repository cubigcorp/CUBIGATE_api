Doctor: Where are you having pain? 
Patient: My left elbow. I hit it against a railing when I was trying to do a new trick on my skateboard. 
Doctor: Did the pain come on gradually?  
Patient: Yeah. I even tried icing it, but I think it's only gotten worse. 
Doctor: Did you injure any other parts of your body? 
Patient: Only my elbow. 
Doctor: How long ago did this happen? 
Patient: About a week ago. 
Doctor: I see. Have you taken anything for it, such as Advil or Tylenol? 
Patient: No. I try to deal with the pain as best as I can before resorting to medicine.
