Doctor: Welcome into the clinic! I would like to start with your past medical history.  
Patient: I have high blood pressure and macular deterioration. Last year I caught pneumonia but that has cleared up.
Doctor: Okay.  What brings you in today? 
Patient: I have had this cough and pain on the right side of my abdomen. 
Doctor: How long has this been going on? 
Patient: Two days. I have had body aches and have been feeling nauseous too. 
Doctor: Have you had a fever? 
Patient: I think so. I was chilled and my forehead was warm. The cough is a dry sounding cough. 
Doctor: Does the abdominal pain come during one of these coughing episodes? 
Patient: Yes.
