Doctor: How are you? I haven't seen you in a long time.
Patient: I'm doing fine. I hurt my hand the other day. 
Doctor: How did that happen? 
Patient: My husband and I moved into our new home, and we were building a desk. I tried to nail something in, and I hammered my hand. 
Doctor: Oh, no. So, you and your husband live together now? 
Patient: Yeah. We do. We just got married.
