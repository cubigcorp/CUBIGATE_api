Doctor: Hello there, how are you? 
Patient: I am good, thank you for asking.
Doctor: So, what brings you in today?
Patient: Well, I think I am suffering from memory loss, like short term memory loss.
Doctor: Okay, and why do you say so? 
Patient: I have been under tremendous stress for the last five to ten years. I am currently working for T mobile customer service and my work is really hectic. It requires a lot of technical knowledge with project deadlines which is adding to my stress. 
Patient: Sometimes I have trouble absorbing all the technical knowledge and computer skills or customer issues.
Doctor: Hm.
Patient: I did my M B A in business for a reason, I wanted to make a good career, but this job is very demanding and stressful. I previously worked at a bank in Conway Springs, Norwich. I have worked many jobs around accounting and management services, but my current job is a high stress one.
Doctor: I see, are you married? 
Patient: I have been widowed for past eleven years. My husband died in a car accident, he was hit by drunk driver. It was not the time for my husband to go! After he left, I had to take care of everything and that's another reason for my stress from the past several years. 
Doctor: I am so sorry to hear that.
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor: Okay, so tell me any weakness or dizziness or lethargy in the past or now?
Patient: No.
Doctor: Any history of stroke?
Patient: No.
