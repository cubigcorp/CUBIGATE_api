Doctor: Hi Gina, how are you?
Patient: I wish, I was in better state but yeah, I am okay. 
Doctor: I understand. So, you are here for your follow up post your surgeries, right?
Patient: Yes, I am.
Doctor: Alright, I see you recently had your left breast removed due to cancer.
Patient: Correct.
Doctor: And then you also had your right knee replaced due to arthritis in your kneecap, right?
Patient: Yeah, I had arthritis in my knee bone so I got it replaced. 
Doctor: Hm.
