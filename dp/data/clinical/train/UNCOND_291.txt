Doctor: So, does high blood pressure run in your family?
Patient: Um, no it's just me.
Doctor: Okay and this was your first time? 
Patient: Yes. 
Doctor: Because I am looking at your previous charts and I don't see it mentioned before.
Patient: Oh yeah first time it shot up this high. I never had a high blood pressure problem before.
