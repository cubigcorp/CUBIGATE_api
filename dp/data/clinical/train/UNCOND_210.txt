Doctor: Hello. Are you a new patient? 
Patient: I am. I've been traveling a lot, so I don't have a local doctor I usually see. 
Doctor: That's fine. What is the reason for your visit? 
Patient: I've had this dark spot on my leg for a long time. 
Doctor: I see. Do you know if your family has any chronic medical problems? 
Patient: Not that I know of. 
Doctor: That's good. I think I'll be able to remove it surgically. Before I go over the procedures, have you had a surgery before? 
Patient: Yeah, I have. I had surgery on my back and to remove my appendix. 
Doctor: Sounds good. Other than that dark spot, you seem to be very healthy.
