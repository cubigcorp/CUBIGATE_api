Doctor: I see here that you're in for a med refill. Is that correct? 
Patient: Yep. I ran out of Klonopin one or two days ago. 
Doctor: What are you taking it for? And how long have you been on it? 
Patient: Panic attacks. I have really bad episodes without it. Um I think I started it about four months ago. I could be wrong though. I've lost track of time.
Doctor: Who usually prescribes it to you? 
Patient: My doctor back in Georgia. 
Doctor: Do you happen to have their name or contact info on hand? 
Patient: No, unfortunately.  
Doctor: How much Klonopin do you take for your panic attacks? 
Patient: I take a pretty low dose. I think I'm on zero point five milligrams a day. Is there any way you could verify the dosage? 
Doctor: I can try to look it up online. When were you last prescribed Klonopin? 
Patient: Over two months ago I think. 
Doctor: Let me pull up the page and see if we can figure out your dosage and when you're due for a refill based on your doctor's orders.  
Patient: Okay, thank you. 
Doctor: Are you experiencing any symptoms currently, such as headache, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath or chest pain?
Patient: Not right now, no. I did have some nausea yesterday. Oh and I guess I had a slight headache when I woke up this morning, but that's about it.
