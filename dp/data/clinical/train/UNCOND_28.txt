Doctor: Hello sir. Let me first start by asking your age. How old are you? 
Patient: I'm twenty four.  
Doctor: So, what brought you here? How can I help you? 
Patient: I was out for fishing this weekend, I think I got into some poison ivy and I have these rashes all over my chest, legs, arms and also some are on my back. 
Doctor: You seem so confident of it being poison ivy has it happened before? 
Patient: Oh yes, it has happened several times before. It usually takes some time to get over. Last time I was here Doctor Blackman gave me a steroid injection. 
Doctor: Okay, let me check my records. It looks like he gave you eighty milligrams of depomedrol. How was it last time after the injection? 
Patient: It worked fine. It did take us some time to get rid of it. 
Doctor: Did you take any medicine or anything else this time?
Patient: I took over the counter Benadryl. Also, I'm applying cortisone cream on the rashes. 
Doctor: Did they help you? 
Patient: I saw a little bit of improvement. But this weekend it seemed to have been worst.
Doctor: No worries, let's set you up for another injection.
