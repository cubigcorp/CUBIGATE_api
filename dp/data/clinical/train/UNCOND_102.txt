Doctor: What is wrong with your back honey?
Patient: Oh, it all started off with a little pimple on the buttock.  I was soaking it at home with hot water and stuff, but it did not improve. I hope this is not cancer. I am only twenty four. 
Doctor: Okay what exactly are you experiencing?
Patient: I have pain.
Doctor: So you came to the hospital on the first and they did an I and D in E D?
Patient:   Yes I was admitted to the hospitalist service with high blood sugars. My African American father was so scared. 
Doctor: Okay sugars high. Do you know the number? How high?
Patient: No, I do not know that but they found positive bacteria or some sort of thing in my blood culture. 
Doctor:  So today we are evaluating you for surgery?
Patient: Yes.
