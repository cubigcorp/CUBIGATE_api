Doctor: Hello and welcome to our dermatology office. What is the reason for your visit? 
Patient: I have these rashes on my arms. 
Doctor: Let me take a look. Do you have prior reports about your history? 
Patient: Yeah, I do. I gave it to the nurse. 
Doctor: Let me go get it really quick. I'm reading the report and it looks like your family is positive for atopy. 
Patient: Oh, yeah. We all usually get some type of rash. 
Doctor: I see. Do you know if you have psoriasis? 
Patient: Uh. What's that's? 
Doctor: It's a skin disease that usually has scaly patches. 
Patient: Uhm. I don't think so. 
Doctor: Great. Before I prescribe you medicine to treat your eczema, are you allergic to any drugs?
Patient: Not that I know of.
