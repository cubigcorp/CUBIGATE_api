Doctor: And are you working? What do you do?
Patient: Oh, I am a catholic priest!
Doctor: Oh wow! 
Patient: Yes. 
Doctor: And if you don't mind me asking, do you drink alcohol?
Patient: Maybe that is something for my confession box but jokes apart I don't drink.
Doctor: Sorry I need to ask these questions it's a protocol.
Patient: I understand. 
Doctor: And can I put down here that you don't smoke or use any kinds of drugs?
Patient: Yes, I don't do those either. 
Doctor: Cool.
