Doctor: Out of ten, ten being the worst pain imaginable, how would you rate your pain today? 
Patient: Today it's about a six or seven, and it's usually pretty constant there. 
Doctor: Does the pain change with the weather? 
Patient: Yes, when it's cold out it turns to ten out of ten. It's better when it's warm out. 
Doctor: Does the pain change throughout the course of the day? 
Patient: Yes, it progressively gets worse and worse as the day goes on, but I also have a pretty hard time getting out of bed in the morning, too. 
Doctor: Out of ten, how would you rate your pain at night? 
Patient: Oh, it's ten out of ten. 
Doctor: Does the pain wake you up at night? 
Patient: If I sleep at all. I'm not sleeping well at all, and when I do it's for less than an hour at a time. 
Doctor: Are there any activities that really aggravate the pain? 
Patient: Yes, if I sit for more than about twenty minutes, or if I lay flat on my back. 
Doctor: Does anything alleviate the pain?
Patient: Laying on my side helps a little.
