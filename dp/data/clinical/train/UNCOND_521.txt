Doctor: Good morning, ma'am. 
Patient: Good morning, doctor. 
Doctor: Welcome to A B C D General Hospital. My nurse says that you are forty one years old, and you identify as a White female, is that correct? 
Patient: Yes, that's all correct. 
Doctor: Thank you, so, what seems to be the trouble today?
Patient: Well, I'm having some pain in this foot, it's right over this bone. 
Doctor: Is your pain right here?
Patient: Yes, it really hurts right there. 
Doctor: Okay, this is known as your navicular bone. What makes the pain worse? 
Patient: Usually wearing shoes makes it worse. 
Doctor: Do you have any past history of problems with this foot?
Patient: Well, I have a history of multiple osteochondromas. 
Doctor: Do they know what caused these? 
Patient: No, no one ever figured it out, they just said it was hereditary.  
Doctor: Have they done surgery on these in the past? 
Patient: Yeah, I had a surgery for this a while ago. 
Doctor: Have you ever had this problem in your feet or spine?
Patient: No, this is new. Can we do that surgery again? I can't take this pain.
