Doctor: How did your last visit go with the cardiologist? 
Patient: Good.  
Doctor: It looks like they diagnosed you with sick sinus syndrome. Do you have any questions about this new diagnosis? 
Patient: No, she explained everything to me. I'm planning to follow-up with her in the next two weeks. 
Doctor: Great. So it looks like your past medical history is the same? Nothing new other than the sick sinus syndrome.
