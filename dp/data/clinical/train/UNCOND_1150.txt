Doctor: Hello, Mister G, how are you today?
Patient: I am good doctor thank you for asking. I am here to talk to you about my will.
Doctor: Yeah, nurse informed me. So, tell me how can I help you?
Patient: As you know I have terminal cancer. I have decided I do not want to be resuscitated. I have appointed my daughter as my legal healthcare proxy and she respects my wish.
Doctor: Tell me what I can do to make you comfortable? 
Patient: Honestly doctor you have done enough and I am so thankful for that. I just wish to spend my last days at home surrounded with loved ones. I have my nurse, she takes care of me. I think I am fine! 
Doctor: Alright my friend.
