Doctor: Hi, how can I help you?
Patient:  I am here for a follow up on my heart rhythm problem. I think it is atrial fibrillation.
Doctor: Oh yes. You are not on Cardizem and your heart rate is up just a little bit today. 
Patient: That's right. I misplaced it.
Doctor: Okay. Let me see. What symptoms are you experiencing right now?
Patient: I am feeling very dizzy. I do have some vertigo and lightheadedness. 
Doctor: You are on blood thinners, right? That is Coumadin therapy? Or am I wrong here?
Patient: No, you are right but please stop the Coumadin. I am tired of these regular blood draws.
Doctor: See, I understand it is hard to control it. It is difficult to regulate that.
Patient: Yes exactly. That is why I don't want it. Give me something simple.
Doctor: Okay I will investigate it. Are you experiencing any chest pain or shortness of breath?
Patient: Oh no, I am not feeling that.
Doctor: Okay great!
Patient: Actually, I am moving around a little bit better now and my arm does not hurt.
Doctor: How about your back pain?
Patient: Um, it is improving as well. 
Doctor: Okay, cool.
Patient: Yeah.
