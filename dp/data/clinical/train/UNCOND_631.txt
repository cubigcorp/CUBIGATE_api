Doctor: Hi, how are you doing? How old are you?
Patient: I am good, how are you? I am seventy two years old.
Doctor: Good. How can I help?
Patient: Actually, there is a wooden splinter stuck beneath my left fifth fingernail. I am an American farmer by blood, so this has happened before.
Doctor: Oh, when did this happen, sir?
Patient: Yesterday evening around four P M.
Doctor: Okay, then what did you do?
Patient: Then I tried to remove it with tweezers at home, but it did not come out. So, I want you to remove this. 
Doctor: Okay let me see.
Patient: Yeah, here.
Doctor: Okay. Can you tell me when the last time you had a tetanus shot?
Patient: Oh it's been so long. I would say it has been over ten years since I have had any tetanus shot.
Doctor: Okay and are you allergic to anything?
Patient: Oh yes. I am allergic to horse serum. I think it is added in vaccinations?
Doctor: Oh, okay. 
Patient: But I don't want any tetanus vaccine now. 
Doctor: Oh! But you need it.
Patient: I know, but I get a bad reaction to vaccines so I don't want it.
Doctor: Okay. let me fine some alternative.
Patient: Thanks.
