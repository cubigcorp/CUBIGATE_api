Doctor: Hello again, how are you doing, miss? 
Patient: I'm good. Thank you. How about you? 
Doctor: All good here too. I know you are an established patient of dermatology here and was last seen in our office on July thirteenth, two thousand and four.  I will be asking you a few questions just to check whether the entry in our record is updated or not.
Doctor: How old are you now? 
Patient: Twenty nine. 
Doctor: Where are you from originally? 
Patient: I'm from Vietnam. 
Doctor: I am seeing you today as a referral from A B C for reevaluation. 
Patient: Yes, for my hand eczema. 
Doctor: So, let's see what you have been treated with. Your record here says with Aristocort cream, Cetaphil cream, increased moisturizing cream and lotion. Does this sound right to you? 
Patient: Yes, that's correct. 
Doctor: Are you washing your hands in Cetaphil cleansing lotion? 
Patient: Yes, I'm doing all that. 
Doctor: What brings you here today? 
Patient: I'm having this flaring. My hands are all dry. I have these like cracks in my hands. I have been washing with the soap and the lotions that you prescribed, but still, it is happening. Maybe because of cracks or what, I don't know, but the Cetaphil cleansing lotion, whenever I'm applying that it is causing me a lot of burning pain. I have been wearing gloves though. 
Doctor: Are you married? 
Patient: Still, a single. I'm not even looking for a husband yet. 
Doctor: Are you working somewhere? 
Patient: Not currently.
