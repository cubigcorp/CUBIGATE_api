Doctor: So, you are a cigarette smoker? 
Patient: Yeah. 
Doctor: How much do you some? 
Patient: Not as much as some people. 
Doctor: How much is that exactly? 
Patient: Well, I probably buy a new pack once a week. 
Doctor: Okay. So that is about four packs a month and fifty packs a year. 
Patient: Yeah, I guess so.
