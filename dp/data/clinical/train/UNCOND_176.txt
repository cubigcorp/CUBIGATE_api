Doctor: You have an infection that has become septic. We are going to have to start you on intravenous antibiotics. 
Patient: Okay. 
Doctor: We also need to address the blood clotting. I am going to give you an anticoagulant to prevent any further clotting issues. Do you have any questions? 
Patient: No.
