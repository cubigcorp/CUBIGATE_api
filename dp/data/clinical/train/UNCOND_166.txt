Doctor: Hello. Are you ready for your surgery today? 
Patient: I'm ready as can be. This isn't my first rodeo. 
Doctor: I see. Have you had surgeries before? 
Patient: Yeah, I have. I think it's in my report that you have with you. 
Doctor: You're right. It says here you've had some stripping of veins in your legs, a tonsillectomy, and a adenoidectomy.
