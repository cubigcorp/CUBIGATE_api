Doctor: Hello, miss. How can I help?
Patient: Well, I just turned fifty seven this year and I would like to get rid of these wrinkles on my face. I don't like them one bit. 
Doctor: You look beautiful and actually have a lot of fullness in the face.  It is great that you do not smoke and do not have history of skin disease. We can definitely help you with these minor issues.
