Patient: Hey, man. 
Doctor: Hey, how's it going? It's been a while. 
Patient: Yeah, it's been a while that's for sure. 
Doctor: So anything new I should know of? 
Patient: Uh I had some stuff on my chest that I saw a dermatologist for. 
Doctor: What type of stuff? 
Patient: I think they were cysts. 
Doctor: Any cause for concern? 
Patient: Nah, the dermatologist said everything came back alright. 
Doctor: Glad to hear that.  
Patient: Me too. I'm actually here to see if you can write me up a P P D slip.  
Doctor: Is this for a job?
Patient: Yeah, my last one was negative, but I need to get another one. Last one I did was in nineteen ninety four.
