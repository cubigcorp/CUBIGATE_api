Doctor: Good afternoon, sir. My nurse has it written down here that that you're a thirty three year old black male, is that correct? 
Patient: Yes, doctor, that's correct. 
Doctor: Great, what seems to be the problem today, sir? 
Patient: Well, I think I'm having some sexual dysfunction. I was wondering if Cialis would help. 
Doctor: What makes you think this, sir? 
Patient: Well, I did a quiz online on the Cialis website and I didn't score in the normal range, so I figured I would come in. 
Doctor: Is there anything else of note, sir? 
Patient: Well, there may be some decreased desire, but honestly, I don't think that's the main problem here. I'd like to have my erections last longer, doctor. 
Doctor: What was this quiz like? 
Patient: Well, on the quiz, I said that less than half of the time I'm able to get an erection and keep an erection after penetration. 
Doctor: Are you having difficulty maintaining an erection until completion? 
Patient: Well, I'd say there's slight difficulty. 
Doctor: Okay, do you have any significant medical conditions in the past that you have been treated for? 
Patient: No, not that I know of. 
Doctor: What about testicular infections? 
Patient: No, that sounds painful, but no. 
Doctor: Have you had any traumatic injuries to the groin? 
Patient: No, not that I can remember. 
Doctor: What about hernias? You can get them from playing sports or lifting weights. Have you ever had one of these? 
Patient: No, that doesn't sound familiar either.
