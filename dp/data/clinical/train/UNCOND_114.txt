Doctor: How are you dealing with your pain now? 
Patient: Oh no, I have no issues with my pain. Today I'm here for a different cause. I'm having this weakness all around on my left side, especially in my arm. I feel like I cannot lift anything like even a glass of water. It's hard for me to lift it up. I'm not able to walk properly, let alone the balancing and everything else. It's just that my whole left side seems to be weak.
