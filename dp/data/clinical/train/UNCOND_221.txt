Doctor: Do you live alone? 
Patient: I wouldn't say I live alone. I have three cats and they always keep me company.  
Doctor: Aw, what kind of cats? 
Patient: Two Persian cats and one Chartreux. 
Doctor: Are you currently working? 
Patient: I retired a few months ago. I used to work as a psych aide for the State of Pennsylvania. 
Doctor: Congratulations on your retirement. 
Patient: Thank you. 
Doctor: How long did you work as a psych aide? 
Patient: Thirty two years. 
Doctor: Incredible. One more question. Do you smoke, drink, or use drugs recreationally?  
Patient: I drink wine every now and then. I used to smoke back in the day, but I'm five years smoke free. I do not do drugs.  
Doctor: Always great to hear.
