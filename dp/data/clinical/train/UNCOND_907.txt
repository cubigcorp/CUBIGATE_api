Doctor: How long has your finger been in pain, sir?
Patient: Well, at this point, it's been more than a few months. 
Doctor: Have you seen another doctor for this pain?
Patient: Yeah, I saw another guy a little while ago.
Doctor: Do you have the records from the visit?
Patient: Yeah, actually, they're right here. 
Doctor: Okay, so I see you have a trigger finger, and a mucous cyst, and this other doctor gave you injections. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes sir. 
Doctor: Did the injections help at all?
Patient: No sir, honestly, they did nothing. 
Doctor: So, your finger is still locking today?
Patient: Yes sir, the other doctor referred me over here to see if there was anything more we could do. I'd like to try surgery.
