Doctor: Do you have any chronic medical conditions that I should know about? 
Patient: What do you mean by that, doctor? 
Doctor: Well, it could be anything from high blood pressure, to depression, to cancer. Do any of those sound familiar? 
Patient: Oh, yeah, I have a few things like that. I have anemia, high cholesterol, and, um, hypothyroidism.
