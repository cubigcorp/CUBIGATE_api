Doctor: Good afternoon, ma'am. Before we begin, can you confirm your age for me, please? 
Patient: Sure, I'm fifty six years old. 
Doctor: Great, thank you. What seems to be the problem today? 
Patient: Well, I have a history of systemic lupus erythematosus. 
Doctor: How have you been treated for this in the past? 
Patient: Um, I went to a rheumatologist about four months ago, I had discomfort in both of my hands. 
Doctor: Which hand was worse? 
Patient: My left was worse than my right at that time. 
Doctor: Have you seen anyone else for this?
Patient: Um, I came in on October thirtieth two thousand seven. I was having the same problem. 
Doctor: What did they do for you at that time? 
Patient: They have me a trial of Elavil because they thought it was, um, ulnar or radial neuropathy. 
Doctor: Did they give you any topical creams? 
Patient: Yeah, they gave me a prescription for Zostrix but I couldn't fill it because of my insurance. 
Doctor: I see, have your symptoms gotten worse since they began? 
Patient: Yeah, especially here, at the base of my left hand, like around my wrist.
Doctor: Which fingers do you feel it in? If any? 
Patient: Right here, doctor. 
Doctor: Okay, these are your second, third, and fourth fingers. Do you have any other symptoms of note? 
Patient: Um, actually yeah, I've been having some respiratory problems for the last three days or so. 
Doctor: What symptoms have you been experiencing? 
Patient: Um, I've had a dry cough and I feel like I've had a fever but I haven't taken my temperature. 
Doctor: Have you had any night sweats or chills? 
Patient: No, not that I can remember. 
Doctor: Have you had any chest pain or discomfort?
Patient: No. 
Doctor: What about shortness of breath, or G I problems? 
Patient: Thankfully, no.
