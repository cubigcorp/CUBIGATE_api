Doctor: Welcome to A B C D General Hospital. Before we get started, ma'am, how old are you? 
Patient: I'm thirty nine, doctor. 
Doctor: Great, and what seems to be the problem today?
Patient: I've had this bunion for a good few months now. 
Doctor: Is the pain getting worse?
Patient: Absolutely, I can't take it anymore. 
Doctor: How have you managed this bunion so far? 
Patient: I got some wider shoes, and it's done absolutely nothing.
Doctor: I see. 
Patient: Is there surgery or something we can do? I can't take the pain.
