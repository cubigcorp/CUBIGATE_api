Doctor: Hello, this is your follow up visit, right? Welcome back! Have you been taking your Plaquenil for lupus, ma'am? 
Patient: Yeah, I am. 
Doctor: Your prescription is two hundred M G twice a day, correct? 
Patient: Yeah, that's it. 
Doctor: Do you have your eye report with you today? 
Patient: Yes, doctor. Here you go. 
Doctor: Good, thank you, what seems to be the problem today?
Patient: Well, I'm having some aches and pains in my hands and elbows. 
Doctor: When did this pain start?
Patient: It's been a few weeks now. 
Doctor: Is there any associated trauma? Did you fall? 
Patient: No, no falls or anything. It just started one day, and it's really bothering me. 
Doctor: Are you having any fever or chills, or cold or flu like symptoms? 
Patient: No, I'm not. 
Doctor: How about swelling? Are any of your joints swollen? 
Patient: No, everything is normal there. Of note, I have been losing a lot of hair recently. 
Doctor: Okay, that's interesting.
