Doctor: Hi, how are you?
Patient: I am good, Doctor. 
Doctor: So, I see you recently moved to U S A from Brazil, right?
Patient: Yes, about one year back. I was an engineer manager back there, but my job was so stressful that when I got admitted in the M B A program here in the states, I took it.
Doctor: Wow, that's quite a move!
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor: How about your family; wife or girlfriend? 
Patient: I am a one women man. I married my childhood sweetheart. 
Doctor: Nice. Did you travel outside the country recently or have risk of any kind of exposure? 
Patient: No, I haven't traveled anywhere not even within the country. 
Doctor: Okay. Tell me something, do you smoke or drink?
Patient: No, I don't. 
Doctor: And have you in the past used any recreational or illegal drugs? 
Patient: No, never. 
Doctor: Okay, good.
