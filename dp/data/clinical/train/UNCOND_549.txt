Doctor: What is up with your teeth man? It's been giving you problems huh?
Patient: Yes, yes, many, many problems. Firstly, they pulled out so many teeth and now I have this bad tooth problem. 
Doctor: Oh, so this is new? 
Patient: Yes, it's a new pain. Right now it has been going on for three days on left side's upper and lower teeth. 
Doctor: Then why didn't you go and visit your regular dentist?
Patient: I would have but I have missed so many appointments that they now do not allow me to schedule regular appointments. So they put me on a standby appointment now.
Doctor: Oh I am sorry.
Patient: It is okay.
Doctor: Okay any other problems or any other complaints?
Patient: No.
Doctor:  How about any recent illnesses or injuries?
Patient: No, no illness whatsoever.
Doctor: Do you have any medicine at home for pain?
Patient: Yes I have  OxyContin and Vicodin at home. I use it for my knee pain. But I want more pain medicines. I do not want to use up that medicine for my toothache.
Doctor: Okay I understand. How old are you again?
Patient: I am twenty nine.
