Patient: Man, what a night.  
Doctor: What kind of car were you driving that night? 
Patient: I was driving my small sports car through an intersection when another car hit me from the left side. The impact forced my car off the road and into a utility pole. 
Doctor: I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm glad that you are here in one piece. Were you wearing your seatbelt? 
Patient: Yeah, I had my belt on and everything. 
Doctor: Good.  
Patient: Unfortunately, the driver was drunk and ran a traffic signal.  
Doctor: That's such a shame. Do you remember how fast the car was going when it collided into you?
Patient: If I had to guess maybe eighty miles per hour. It looks like the driver who hit me was already cited by police.  
Doctor: Did you lose consciousness at all?  
Patient: Yeah, I briefly lost consciousness when help arrived at the scene. I felt an immediate headache when I regained consciousness. I also had lower back and neck pain.  
Doctor: Did you get out of the car by yourself?  
Patient: Yeah, I got out by myself. Once I made it out, the Rescue Squad drove me to Saint Thomas Memorial Hospital. I was seen in the emergency room and later discharged. 
Doctor: This was on January fifteenth, correct? 
Patient: Yessir.
