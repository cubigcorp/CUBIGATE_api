Doctor: Good afternoon, champ, how you holding up?
Patient: Good afternoon, Doctor, I have a lot of lower back pain. 
Doctor: Oh no, before we begin, how old are you, sir and which hand do you write with?
Patient: I'm seventy five now. Right.
Doctor: Great, so tell me, how long have you had this lower back pain? 
Patient: It's been about ten days now. 
Doctor: Have your symptoms improved at all since they began? 
Patient: No, they keep getting worse. 
Doctor: Does the pain radiate into your legs? 
Patient: Yes, it started radiating down my right leg three days after the lower back pain began, and then the left leg three days after the right. The next day I could barely walk, the pain was so severe. 
Doctor: Do you remember the initial date of the beginning of your low back pain? 
Patient: Um, it was on December third nineteen ninety five. 
Doctor: Have you seen another doctor for this pain? 
Patient: Yes, I saw my local physician, um, it was on December eleventh, but he wasn't able to pinpoint what was going on. 
Doctor: What kind of treatments did he recommend? 
Patient: He gave me some antiinflammatories and sent me on my way. 
Doctor: Did you drive yourself? 
Patient: Yes, I did. 
Doctor: How did the antiinflammatories work? 
Patient: Um, by the time I got home, I could hardly walk due to the back pain, and I had weakness in my legs. I was, however, able to feed my dogs, and I fixed myself some dinner. 
Doctor: Was there any leg numbness? 
Patient: Yes. Since December eleventh. 
Doctor:  Have you seen an orthopedist for this pain? 
Patient: Yes, I saw one the day after my primary care physician, but my legs gave out and I fell while walking to my car because of the leg weakness and back pain.  
Doctor: What kind of imaging studies did that orthopedist do? 
Patient: He did a C T and x rays of my lower back, but he didn't see anything wrong. He recommended I follow up at U I H C. The imaging was on my L S Spine.
