Doctor: Hi, what is going on?
Guest_family: She was doing well until this morning, but now she can barely move her right arm and is having speech issues. She can't seem to comprehend words. I think it is a stroke. 
Doctor: We see this a lot at A B C Medical Center. I am glad you came. You just saw Doctor H, right?
Guest_family: Yes. We did a C T head scan and labs. 
Doctor: Okay. Where is she living? With you?
Guest_family: No. She is at the Life Care Center. 
Doctor: Ma'am, do you have headache or chest pain?
Patient: What? What? Huh?
Guest_family: She has not complained of anything like that. 
Doctor: Ma'am. Do you have vision issues?
Patient: What? I can see. Of course I can see. 
Doctor:  Any shortness of breath?
Guest_family: She is breathing fine. 
Doctor: Have your symptoms improved at all? Or have they worsened since this morning?
Guest_family: No. They have stayed constant.
