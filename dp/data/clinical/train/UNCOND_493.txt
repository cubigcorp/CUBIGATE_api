Doctor: So what brings you in today? 
Patient: Ugh. 
Doctor: I'm guessing you're not feeling too great. 
Patient: You got that right. I've had a fever on and off for the past few days. 
Doctor: When was the last time you took your temperature? 
Patient: Right before I drove here.  
Doctor: I see. Did the nurse take your temperature when you came in? 
Patient: Yes, she did.  
Doctor: Have you been experiencing cold like symptoms, such as cough, nasal congestion, headache, or nausea? 
Patient: Um no not really. 
Doctor: Have you tried taking any medicine to help with the fever? 
Patient: Yeah. I've taken Tylenol and that's helped a bit. 
Doctor: Have you had recent sick contacts? 
Patient: I don't think so. I live with three other roommates and they seem fine.
