Doctor: Hello. What is the reason for your visit today? 
Patient: I keep having this dry cough and it gets hard to breathe at times. 
Doctor: Were you exposed to anything recently? 
Patient: Here's a note from a contractor that worked on my house recently. I wasn't sure what it meant. 
Doctor: I see. It looks like you may have been exposed to asbestos. 
Patient: Oh, no! Am I going to be fine? 
Doctor: I'll take a look, but I want to ask you a quick question. Did you have any family living with you at the time? 
Patient: Nope. I live alone, so my family wasn't there to be exposed.
