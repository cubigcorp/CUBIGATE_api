Doctor: Did you observe any blood?
Patient: No.
Doctor: Okay, any diarrhea?
Patient: No, on the contrary I am having constipation every now and then, it's really bothering me now. I feel bloated all the time and don't feel fresh in the morning or throughout the day.
Doctor: Oh, how long have you had this problem? 
Patient: Couple of months now. 
Doctor: Hm, I see, does it hurt you to pass stool? Did you notice any blood?
Patient: No. I use suppositories.
Doctor: Oh, that's great. You are doing the right thing. In addition to that I will prescribe you some strong laxative you can drink that in morning it should help.
Patient: Okay! 
Doctor: Any complains of heart burn or acidity or stomach pain?
Patient: No, not really. I do get this twisty pain in my stomach sometimes which I think is mainly due to my constipation.
Doctor: Yeah, you can get that kind of pain with constipation. Any cough or cold like symptoms? Any cough with sputum? 
Patient: No, I feel fine. 
Doctor: Okay, basically I don't think you have any stomach ulcer or anything, but we need to treat your constipation because I know it can be really uncomfortable.
