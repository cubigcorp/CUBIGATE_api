Doctor: Good morning, ma'am. Just to confirm, you're thirty two years old, correct? 
Patient: Yes, doctor, that's correct. 
Doctor: Good, so, have you been able to get a P C P yet? 
Patient: No, I haven't gotten one just yet. 
Doctor: Are you in the process of getting one? 
Patient: Yeah, Project Access is trying to find me one. 
Doctor: Good, um, what seems to be the problem today, then? 
Patient: Well, I was at Doctor X Y Z's office today, I had an appointment, but they cancelled me because I don't have the Project Access insurance yet. 
Doctor: I see, what were you going to see Doctor X Y Z for? 
Patient: I'm having a lot of pain in my foot. 
Doctor: Okay, have you seen Doctor X Y Z before? 
Patient: Yeah, I saw him on May fourteenth two thousand four. 
Doctor: But you still don't have a P C P, correct? 
Patient: Yes, that's correct. 
Doctor: Okay, we've seen you quite a few times in here. You were in here last week and saw Doctor X Y Z for some back pain, how did they treat you? 
Patient: Um, I got some pain medicines and muscle relaxers. 
Doctor:  Okay, so, can you tell me more about your foot, please? 
Patient: Well, I have this pain in my foot, and I had surgery before so there's plates and screws in it.
Doctor: Have you ever talked to anyone about removing this hardware? 
Patient: Well, I was supposed to see Doctor X Y Z about it, but since that appointment was cancelled, I came here. 
Doctor: I see, how long have you had this foot pain? 
Patient: Um, it started hurting a lot yesterday. 
Doctor: Is there any injury here? 
Patient: No, it's just chronically painful, honestly. 
Doctor: Do any activities bother it? 
Patient: Yeah, I can't exercise without a lot of pain. 
Doctor: I see, well, we've x rayed this before, and I see the hardware in there, but there's no apparent abnormality or evidence of loosening, at least from what I can see.
