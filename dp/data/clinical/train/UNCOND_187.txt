Doctor: How's it going? 
Patient: Good, can't complain. 
Doctor: Glad to hear. So today we're going to do a comprehensive eval. It'll be a bit different than our usual visits together. Would you like your mom to step in the room, too? 
Patient: Yeah, that's not a problem.  
Doctor: Alright. I'll grab her from the waiting room. I'll be right back.
