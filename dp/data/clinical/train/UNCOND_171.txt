Doctor: So, tell me about your family's medical history.
Patient: Hm, my mother passed away due to cancer.
Doctor: Oh, what type? 
Patient: Actually, I don't know that. 
Doctor: Okay.
Patient: And my dad died due to heart attack.
Doctor: Oh.
Patient: Yeah. 
Doctor: Okay, I don't see your vaccination record here, do you have it?
Patient: No, I don't have it. I moved here from a different country a long time ago with barely anything. I don't have any medical records from my past. 
Doctor: I see.
