Doctor: Good afternoon, young lady. 
Patient: Good afternoon, doctor. 
Doctor: How has your weight been since your last visit, with the phentermine? 
Patient: Well, since the last visit I've gained about a pound. 
Doctor: Well, it could be worse, but we're at a plateau, I'd like to see you lose some more per month. 
Patient: Yeah, I've been working really hard, but I haven't been able to get the weight down any further so far. 
Doctor: What has been your lowest weight?
Patient: My lowest? That was one hundred thirty six. I'm just as frustrated as you are, doctor. 
Doctor: Well, if this plateau continues, we should discontinue the phentermine. 
Patient: Why is that? 
Doctor: It shouldn't be used to maintain your weight, but only to get the weight down. So, if it's not serving that purpose, we shouldn't use it. There's no real benefit there. 
Patient: Okay, yes, I agree.
