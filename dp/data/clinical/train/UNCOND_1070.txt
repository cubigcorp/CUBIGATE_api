Doctor: Good afternoon, ma'am. 
Patient: Good afternoon, doctor. 
Doctor: Remind me, how young are you?
Patient: Oh doctor, you flatter me. I'm sixty two years old. 
Doctor: Great, and you've had a rotator cuff repair before, correct? 
Patient: Yes, that's correct. 
Doctor: Good, well, what seems to be the problem today?
Patient: I'm still having a lot of pain in this shoulder. 
Doctor: Oh no, have you had any recent imaging done on this shoulder? 
Patient: Yes, I had an M R I not too long ago, can you take a look? I have it right here. 
Doctor: Thank you, yes, um, this M R I shows that you've torn that rotator cuff again. 
Patient: Oh no, can we do another surgery to repair it again?
Doctor: Yes, we'll have to. 
Patient: What's the risk of infection of the surgery?
Doctor: Its less than one percent. We'll use antibiotics to control for infection the entire time. 
Patient: Will I be asleep again?
Doctor: Yes, you won't feel a thing. 
Patient: Great, yes, I'd like to go forward with the surgery. I need to get back to playing tennis.
