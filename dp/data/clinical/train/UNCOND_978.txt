Doctor: Do you mind elaborating more on your family history? Did either of your parents suffer from any medical problems? 
Patient: Sure. My dad had heart disease. He passed at seventy five. He had a sister with diabetes and I think my mom may have had diabetes as well. 
Doctor: Got it.  
Patient: As for my mom, she had a long history of mini strokes. She didn't have any memory problems or dementia when she passed at eighty five. They believe she passed due to old age. 
Doctor: Thank you for further elaborating. I'm so sorry for your losses. Losing a parent let alone two is profoundly difficult.
