Doctor: Hi there, how are you?
Patient: I am okay.
Doctor: So, I see you turned eighty-eight yesterday, happy birthday!
Patient: Thank you! 
Doctor: And you are referred by Doctor X, he is your primary physician, right?
Patient: Correct! I am also seeing Doctor Y for my leukemia. 
Doctor: Hm he mentioned that it's chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Patient: Yes.
Doctor: Okay.
Doctor: And you are also seeing Doctor Z for your heart related problems.
Patient: That is correct.
Doctor: So, tell me what is happening with you?
Patient: For the past one week I am having this increased shortness of breath and having difficulty breathing from past few nights while sleeping.
Doctor: Okay.
Patient: And this morning I was having difficulty catching my breath. I am also having wheezing since morning.
Doctor: Let me examine you, can you come forward and sit-up here? Any chest discomfort or acute chest pain or anything of that sort? Any pain of the left arm?
Patient: No.
Doctor: Any dizziness, feeling like fainting or light headedness or losing control?
Patient: No.
Doctor: Well, I don't think there is any sign of cardiovascular accident or heart attack, so that's that. You do have mild peripheral edema. We need to treat that.
Patient: Okay.
