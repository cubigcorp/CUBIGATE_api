Doctor: Hello, sir. I'll be your doctor today. How are you feeling? 
Patient: Um uh who? Where am I? 
Doctor: You're in the emergency room. 
Patient: I'm where? 
Doctor: The police found you outside of the local bar. Do you remember what happened prior to your arrival here? 
Patient: I'm no longer at the bar? 
Doctor: No, you're here because someone was worried you may need medical attention.  
Patient: I don't know what's going on. Can you call my girlfriend? She was there with me before we got into a fight.
