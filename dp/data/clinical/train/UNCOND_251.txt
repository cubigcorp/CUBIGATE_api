Doctor: Let me examine your leg. Well your x ray looks fine. No defect there, I don't see any mass or swelling. Are you able to walk or use that leg at all?
Patient: Oh yes, I am using it. I have also started going back on my regular walk. 
Doctor: Good, so your muscle strength is good, no loss of muscle tone there.
Patient: Yeah.
