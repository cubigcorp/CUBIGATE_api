Doctor: Hi, how old are you madam?
Patient: I am ninety three. I am a super duper old Swedish woman.
Doctor: Ha! Not so old okay!
Patient: I had vomiting episodes and I am feeling very nauseous.
Doctor: Oh I am so sorry to hear that.
Patient: I have pain in urination too, I think I might have the U T I?
Doctor: Let's see here. So you already have a right hip issue, bone disease, hypertension, depression, and heart rhythm disorder for a long time.
Patient: Yes that is correct.
Doctor: Let me see what we can do here.
Patient: Thank you doctor.
