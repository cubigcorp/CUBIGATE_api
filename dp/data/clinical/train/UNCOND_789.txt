Doctor: What brings you back into the clinic today?
Patient: I have been having some severe bruising. I have been taking Coumadin for three months now. Am I taking to much Coumadin? 
Doctor: You are taking a normal start dose. Some people do not metabolize the medication as well as others. I would like to get you tested for hypersensitivity. After we get the test results back, we will be able to adjust your dosage accordingly.  
Patient: Okay.
