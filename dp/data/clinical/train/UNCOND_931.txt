Doctor: Hello. How are you all doing today? 
Guest_family: We're doing fine. I'm the mother of my four year old boy. 
Doctor: Hello, ma'am. What seems to be the problem?
Gest_family: We just wanted to follow up after my son's E R visit.
Doctor: Oh, no. What happened?
Guest_family: He was playing at the park and thought it was a good idea to jump off the swing. Crazy kid, right? 
Doctor: It happens. Live and you learn, as they say. Do you have any information from the E R visit.
Guest_family: I gave it to the nurse. Did you not get it?
Guest_clinician: Sorry. I got really busy, but here is the report. 
Doctor: Could you read it to me, please?
Guest_clinician: Of course. So, their son severely injured his left distal humerus. No problems were claimed before the injury. The E R saw him for his deformed elbow. 
Doctor: Are there any exams on the report? 
Guest_clinician: There is an x ray and physical exam. They both confirmed a closed type three supracondylar fracture of his left distal humerus with severe puckering of the skin anteriorly with major ecchymosis in the same region. He did have a radial pulse palpable
Doctor: Thank you, nurse. Mom, were you there before his surgery? 
Guest_family: My husband and I were. My husband rushed from this cultural event he had planned. 
Doctor: I see. What do you all identify as?
Guest_family: We identify as white. 
Doctor: I see. I'm going to perform a neurological exam on your son now. Hi buddy. Is it fine if I do a quick exam? 
Patient: Sure. 
Doctor: Thanks. It'll be quick.  
Patient: Okay. 
Doctor: After doing the exam I see his ulnar, median, and radial nerves are intact. I couldn't do the entire exam because the pain might be too much for him.
Guest_family: Thank you so much for your help.
