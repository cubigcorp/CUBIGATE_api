Doctor: Good morning, ma'am. You're eighty two years old, is that correct? 
Patient: Good morning, doctor. Yes, that's correct. 
Doctor: Good, and just one more piece of background information, which hand do you write with?
Patient: I use my right hand for everything. 
Doctor: Good, so what seems to be the problem today?
Patient: Doctor, I've had years of pain in this shoulder. 
Doctor: What kind of treatments have you had?
Patient: Well, um, I've had antiinflammatories, and rested, and none of it has helped so far. 
Doctor: Can I assume the pain is impacting your daily life? 
Patient: Yes, it certainly is. The pain is unbearable now.
