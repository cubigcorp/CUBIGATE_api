Doctor: Your cholesterol appears to be elevated today. Is this the first time you've been told that your cholesterol levels are high? 
Patient: No, unfortunately. I suffer from a few medical problems so maybe that's to blame. 
Doctor: I see here that you have diabetes and high blood pressure. 
Patient: Right.  
Doctor: Does diabetes or high blood pressure run- 
Patient: In the family? No, but heart disease does.
