Doctor: So, I understand that you had a fall. 
Patient: Yes. I did fall. 
Doctor: What happened? 
Patient: I don't really know. I have balancing problems. I have been to my P C P for this issue a few days ago. I saw her about a week and a half ago because I had another fall. Maybe around late December since today is January seventh.  I have been having trouble with my right hand. It is like I am clumsy on my right side. I ended up falling because my right hand missed the railing when I grabbed it to head up the stairs. 
Doctor: Are you left or right handed? 
Patient: Right. 
Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit more about the trouble that you are having with the right hand? Is it localized to the right hand? 
Patient: Yes, it is only on my right side. It is like the right side of my body is weak and it has been getting worse. 
Doctor: How long has this issue been progressing for? 
Patient: About two years.
Doctor: Have you experienced any blurred vision or visual disturbances?
Patient: Yes. Every once and a while.  
Doctor: How old are you? 
Patient: I just turned fifty eight last week. 
Doctor: Happy belated birthday! 
Patient: Thank you!
Doctor: Did your P C P have any bloodwork or imaging done? 
Patient: Yes, she did. She did both. She said she would send my records over. 
Doctor: Oh. I see it here! Did Doctor Madison discuss the results of your H C T and the M R I yet? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: Okay. The results showed clinoid masses. This explains that problems that you have been having with your right side, your balancing problems, and the visual disturbances. With only the M R I I cannot tell if the masses are malignant or not. 
Patient: So, are the masses cancer? 
Doctor: I don't know yet. I will have to run some more tests and potently have to do a biopsy. 
Patient: Okay.
