Guest_clinician: Hello, doctor. Let me give you a run down as to what we are dealing with today. This patient was last seen in January two thousand and four. She is coming for a follow up on interstitial disease secondary to lupus pneumonitis. I will let her tell you more about what happened yesterday. 
Doctor: Thanks, nurse. How are you feeling today, miss? Welcome back to the Pulmonary Medicine Clinic. What happened yesterday?
Patient: Well, I was doing fine since last time. My respiratory issues have been great and I have had no major difficulties breathing. 
Doctor: That's good to hear. What happened yesterday that caused you to want to come in so urgently?
Patient: Yesterday I noticed that I have some back and joint pain.  When I breathe deep my back hurts. 
Doctor: Are you experiencing any coughing?
Patient: No, coughing at this moment. 
Doctor: Have you been producing any mucus the times that you do cough?
Patient: No, I already said I didn't cough. 
Doctor: Okay. Any fevers or chills?
Patient: Nothing so far. 
Doctor: Do you have any other symptoms currently? 
Patient: I do notice that I am more tired than usual. 
Doctor: During physical activity do you seem out of breath or more tired than usual? I want to see if your pulmonary system is inhibited. 
Patient: No. I don't have issues with breathing when I do daily activities.
