Doctor: Hi there! It is good to see you both. How has everything been going for the both of you? 
Patient: Hi Doctor.  
Guest_family: Things have been pretty good. She has been having some new emotional outbursts. I made an appointment with the down syndrome behavioral specialist that you recommended from the last time we were here.  
Doctor: That is great. Keep me updated on her progress.  Her bloodwork came back showing an underactive thyroid. This explains the recent weight gain and fatigue. I would like to start her on a medication called levothyroxine. We will need to check her bloodwork again in one month to see how her thyroid respond to the medication. 
Guest_family: Okay.  
Doctor: Is there any other concerns you have today? 
Guest_family: Yes. She has this toenail that looks strange and discolored.  
Doctor: Let me look. Can you remove your socks for me? 
Patient: Yes.  
Doctor: Is it this nail? 
Guest_family: Yes.  
Doctor: This is very common. It is called Onychomycosis. It is nail fungus. Since only one nail is affected, I would recommend starting off with a topical treatment. I will send the drops to your pharmacy. You will put on drop on the affected nail, daily.
