Doctor: Are you still working?
Patient: Retired some time ago.
Doctor: What was your profession?
Patient: I used to work at a car repair shop called Champion Automotive Company.
Doctor: Nice. How did you enjoy the work?
Patient: I liked it a lot, but there came a time where I knew it was the end of the road for me. I'm really enjoying retirement. 
Doctor: I bet. I have cousin who owns a car repair shop. He's almost always busy.
