Doctor: How're you feeling today?  
Patient: Terrible. I'm having the worst headache of my life. 
Doctor: I'm so sorry. Well you are only twenty five, so let's hope this is the last of the worst. Let's see how we can best help you. When did it start? 
Patient: Around eleven in the morning. 
Doctor: Today? 
Patient: Um no yesterday. July thirty first. 
Doctor: July thirty first O eight. Got it. Did it come on suddenly? 
Patient: Yeah. 
Doctor: Are you having any symptoms with it, such as blurry vision, light sensitivity, dizziness, lightheadedness, or nausea? 
Patient: I'm having blurry vision and lightheadedness.  I also can't seem to write well. It looks so messy. I am naturally right handed but my writing looks like I am trying with my left. 
Doctor: How would you describe the lightheadedness? 
Patient: Like there are blind spots. 
Doctor: Okay. How about any vomiting? 
Patient: Um no. I feel like my face is pretty swollen though. I don't know if it's related to the headache but it started around the same time. 
Doctor: Here in the E R, we'll do a thorough exam and eval to make sure nothing serious is going on. While we're waiting for your C T results, I'm going to order a migraine cocktail and some Morphine. 
Patient: Thank. Will the nurse be in soon? 
Doctor: Yes, she'll be right in as soon as the order is placed. It shouldn't be more than a few minutes. If it takes longer, then please ring the call bell.
