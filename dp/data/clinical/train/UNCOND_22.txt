Doctor: Any past medical history? 
Patient: Um there were a couple times where I noticed my blood pressure was high but that's improved as of late. 
Doctor: When did these episodes occur? 
Patient: About a year ago. 
Doctor: Did you follow up with your previous doctor? 
Patient: Yeah, my old doctor knows. 
Doctor: Okay then. Let's see. Have you been checking your own blood pressure as a result? 
Patient: No not really.  
Doctor: It looks like your blood pressure was normal today, which is a good sign. 
Patient: Great. 
Doctor: Hm any allergies to medications? 
Patient: None that I know of. 
Doctor: And it looks like you have gained about fourteen pounds since last year. Any new diet changes or stressors? 
Patient: I lost my job last January and it took a pretty big toll on me. 
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. How have you been coping? 
Patient: I'm doing better now but I need to watch what I eat. I tend to eat a lot more when I'm stressed. It's something I'm working on.
