Doctor: Good morning, sir. Remind me please, when was your surgery? 
Patient: Hello, doctor. It was about a week ago now. 
Doctor: Great, and just to remind you, you had a removal of Ex Fix from the right knee with an M U A following O R I F of a right tibial plateau fracture. 
Patient: Yes, that all sounds familiar. What's M U A? 
Doctor: It stands for manipulation under anesthesia. We bent the knee in order to forcibly break up some scar tissue. 
Patient: Oh, wow. 
Doctor: Yeah, it's great, eliminates some need for P T in fact. How are you doing today? 
Patient: Overall, my pain is under control. 
Doctor: Are you having any flu like, or infection symptoms?
Patient: No, nothing like that at all. 
Doctor: So, no fever, or chills, or sweating at night. 
Patient: Yeah, nothing like that. 
Doctor: Great. I see you're having some drainage from the pin sites, but that doesn't bother me too much. 
Patient: Okay, good. I was getting worried. 
Doctor: No need to worry. Are you doing your range of motion exercises? Those are imperative. 
Patient: Yes, doctor. I am. 
Doctor: Good, and do you have any numbness or tingling? 
Patient: No, doctor. I don't have any of that.
