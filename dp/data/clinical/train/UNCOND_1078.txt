Doctor: What do you do for a living? 
Patient: I'm a nursing aid in a nursing home right now.

Doctor: Are you back at Wichita State this semester? 
Patient: No, I decided to take some time off. 
Doctor: Is everything okay? 
Patient: Yeah, I'm just really tired, so I decided to step away for a little.
