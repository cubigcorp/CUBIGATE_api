Doctor: Any muscular pain?
Patient: No, not really. 
Doctor: Any problem in walking? 
Patient: No, it's normal. 
Doctor: Let me check your toes and fingers. Can you move them for me?
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor: Everything looks fine. Nails looks fine too. No bluish discoloration no sign of any infection. Can you push your legs against my hand.
Patient: Both legs?
Doctor: Yes, both. Well, your muscular strength is equal and stable in both legs, so that's fine. Motion looks adequate.
Doctor: Any tenderness? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: And I don't see any swelling or fluid accumulation.
Patient: Okay.
