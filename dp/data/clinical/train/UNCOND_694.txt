Doctor: Hello, sir. How are you doing?
Patient: I am doing well, thanks. Just trying to come to you more regularly to make sure my lungs and heart are okay. 
Doctor: That's great. The previous notes said that you quit smoking. Are you still off?
Patient: Yes, I quit in nineteen ninety six. I come yearly to the doctor's office to make sure that the damage I did to my lungs is monitored. 
Doctor: You have a great attitude. I appreciate when patient's take their health into their own hands. We can only do so much, but it is up to the patient to bring themselves in. 
Patient: Yeah. I smoked for a long time and I know it was bad for me. It was just the norm back in the day. 
Doctor: Do you drink at all?
Patient: I do. Only occasionally.
