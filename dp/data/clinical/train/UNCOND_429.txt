Doctor: How's he feeling today? 
Guest_family: I think this is the worst he's been feeling all week. 
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that he hasn't been feeling well. What symptoms has he been having? 
Guest_family: He's been very congested as of late and seems to be coughing a lot more than usual. He was also running a fever yesterday.  
Doctor: I see. What was his temperature? 
Guest_family: The thermometer was reading one hundred and one degrees Fahrenheit. Does he need to go to the hospital? 
Doctor: Let me evaluate and see what we can do for him today. 
Guest_family: Thank you, doctor. 
Doctor: I suspect that he has an upper respiratory infection, possible pertussis. Is he still experiencing apnea?
