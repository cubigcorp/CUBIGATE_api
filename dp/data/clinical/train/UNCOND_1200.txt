Doctor: Looks like the nurse came in and asked you everything. Ah, she has everything documented here, but I will ask one more time. So, tell me, where do you live? 
Patient: Oh, it's a senior citizen house. They have many nursing aids there. 
Doctor: Do you smoke? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: Do you work? 
Patient: Ah, right now I can't because of this disability, but I used to work as the security guard.
