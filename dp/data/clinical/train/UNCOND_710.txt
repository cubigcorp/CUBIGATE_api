Doctor: Hello Miss Long, I see that you have been referred today by A B C, D O, for a reevaluation. Are you having issues with your hand eczema again? 
Patient: Yes, it has been flaring. 
Doctor: Can you confirm your age for the records please? 
Patient: Sure, I'm twenty nine. 
Doctor: If I'm not wrong, you are from Vietnam, right? 
Patient: That's right.
Doctor: Are you married? Single or with a partner? 
Patient: I'm single. 
Doctor: Are you working somewhere? 
Patient: No, currently I'm unemployed.
Doctor: Okay, since you are an established patient here in our dermatology department, let me just update all your information into the records. 
Doctor: Okay according to my records we have last seen you here in our office on July thirteenth of two thousand and four.
Patient: Yeah, I think so.
Doctor: I have previously treated you with Aristocort cream and Cetaphil cream. I also ask you to increase your moisturizing cream and lotion and asked you to wash your hands in Cetaphil cleansing lotion.
Patient: I've been doing all that, but now it looks like my eczema is flaring. I have these cracks in my hands and they feel very dry. 
Doctor: Have you been washing your hands with Cetaphil cleansing lotion? 
Patient: No, I was using soap. The Cetaphil cleansing lotion was not working.  I had a lot of pain and burning sensation whenever I tried to use that. 
Doctor: It may be because of the fissures. I mean those cracks in your hands. 
Patient: I have been wearing gloves as much as I can. 
Doctor: Okay.
