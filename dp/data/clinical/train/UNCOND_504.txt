Doctor: How old are you now? 
Patient: I am sixty five. My kids just through me a surprise birthday party last week. 
Doctor: Oh wow! That is so nice. Happy belated birthday. 
Patient: It was nice. 
Doctor: It looks like you are here today for a recheck for the prostatitis. 
Patient: Yeah. 
Doctor: I see you have been followed by Doctor Mathis. 
Patient: Yes. 
Doctor: How often do you see him? 
Patient: He has me coming in about every three or four months. 
Doctor: Excellent. And the last time I saw you was in May two thousand and four. 
Patient: Has it been that long? 
Doctor: Yeah, it has. Okay. You are here to discuss some libido problems? 
Patient: Sadly, yes. 
Doctor: How long have you been having these difficulties? 
Patient: I noticed the change when I started taking the Proscar. 
Doctor: That is a common side effect that some men experience from Proscar. Have you tried any medication to help bring back your libido? 
Patient: I take Viagra sometimes. 
Doctor: Does it help at all? 
Patient: There is some improvement. 
Doctor: How many times a night do you get up to relive yourself now? 
Patient: I still get up about three to four times. 
Doctor: Okay, so still often. 
Patient: Yes, but I have not had any U T Is since I have been on the Proscar. 
Doctor: That is good news.
