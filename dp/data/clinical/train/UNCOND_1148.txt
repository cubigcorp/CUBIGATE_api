Doctor: So, sir, are you married?
Patient: Yes, I'm married to my lovely wife. 
Doctor: That's great, so, what did you do for a living? 
Patient: I was a Pepsi Cola truck driver, but thankfully, I'm retired. 
Doctor: Congratulations on your retirement. What seems to be the problem today then?
Patient: Thank you, it's nice to be done with that. The years took their toll though, I have a lot of pain in my back and knees. 
Doctor: Ah, yes, those years of sitting and lifting eventually catch up to everyone.
