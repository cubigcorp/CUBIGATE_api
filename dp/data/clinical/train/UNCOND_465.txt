Doctor: Hello, miss. Could you verify your age, please? 
Patient: I'm fifty five years old. 
Doctor: Great. What is the reason for your visit today? 
Patient: I've been having a lot of problems recently, so I decided to come get it checked out by you. 
Doctor: I see. What kind of problems are you experiencing? 
Patient: Oh, it's a long list. Here it is. 
Doctor: Thank you. Let me take a look. Looks like you have some general allergies and food allergies, loss of taste, problems with your G I tract, asthma, G E R D, and dry mouth or xerostomia. 
Patient: Yeah, that sounds about right. I think I forgot to add it, but I also have bad allergies during the spring time. 
Doctor: Oh, I see. I would describe that as environmental inhalant allergies.
