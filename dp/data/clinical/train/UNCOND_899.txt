Doctor: I just need to confirm a few pieces of information from my nurse before we begin today, sir. 
Patient: Sure, no problem, doctor. 
Doctor: Great, so it says here that you are forty five years old, and you identify as Caucasian. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct. 
Doctor: Thank you, so, what seems to be the problem today?
Patient: Well, I have this pain in my right knee, sir. 
Doctor: Where is your pain? 
Patient: It's right here, on the inside of my right knee. 
Doctor: Is there an injury associated with this pain? 
Patient: Actually, yeah. I twisted it while I was at work.
