Doctor: Hello. Are you ready for your surgery today? 
Patient: Can we reschedule? I'm too scared to do it. 
Doctor: It'll be fine. Don't worry too much about it. Have you ever had a surgery before?
Patient: Never. What if something goes wrong? 
Doctor: You have nothing to worry about. I've done this procedure multiple times, and everyone was fine after. 
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. Let's get started then.
