Doctor: Hello, miss. It looks like some information is missing for your profile. Is it fine if I ask you a few questions? 
Patient: Of course. Go ahead. 
Doctor: Do you currently smoke? 
Patient: No, I finally stopped smoking cigarettes. 
Doctor: Did you smoke before? 
Patient: I did. I smoked a half a pack for about twenty years. 
Doctor: Well, it's good to hear that you've stopped. I encourage you to continue to not smoke. 
Patient: I agree. I need to change up my lifestyle. 
Doctor: Last question. Do you drink alcohol? 
Patient: No, I don't. I don't like anything that has alcohol. I can't stand the taste of it. If I do it is rare.
