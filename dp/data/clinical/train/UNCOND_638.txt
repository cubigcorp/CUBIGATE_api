Doctor: Hello, ma'am. How are you doing?
Patient: My knees hurt. They've been slowly getting worse each year. Life's getting hard at seventy two. 
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you always had knee pain? 
Patient: I have. Both knees are messed up. 
Doctor: Are you able to do any activities still? 
Patient: Nope. I just sit all day. 
Doctor: I see. We can offer to do arthroplasty to fix your knees.
Patient: What's that? 
Doctor: It's like a reconstruction of your joints. It'll help increase your ability to do daily activities. 
Patient: I'm up for it. I need to get my life going. 
Doctor: Sounds great. I just want to confirm some information. Would you say your quality of life and daily activities is decreasing? 
Patient: Oh, yeah. These knees are making my life terrible.
