Doctor: Good afternoon, sir, how are you today? 
Patient: Good afternoon, Doctor, my knees are in a lot of pain today.
Doctor: Is the pain equal? Or is one knee worse than the other?
Patient: Um, the left knee hurts more than the right, but there's pretty significant pain with both. 
Doctor: Is it interfering with your ability to walk? 
Patient: Yes, I can walk like, maybe a half a mile a day, then the pain gets too bad. 
Doctor: Are you able to go up and down stairs?
Patient: I have to take them one at a time. 
Doctor: I see you have degenerative joint disease of both knees, does that ring any bells?
Patient: Yes, but what does that mean?
Doctor: You have arthritis in both of your knees, sir.
Patient: Ah, yes.
Doctor: Have you had surgery on these knees? 
Patient: Um, I had surgery on both of these knees, let me check my notes. It was an, um, arthroscopy. 
Doctor: When were these surgeries?
Patient: They were in the nineteen ninety one nineteen ninety two time frame, somewhere in there.
Doctor: How have you managed this since the surgeries?
Patient: I've taken antiinflammatories, had injections, and I've even used narcotics. 
Doctor: I see. If those haven't helped, I think you'd be a good candidate for knee replacements. 
Patient: Can we do both at the same time?
Doctor: No, let's do the left since that one hurts more. Do you have any other conditions I should know about?
Patient: I've had a lot of back surgeries, I have spinal stenosis. 
Doctor: Do you know what surgeries you've had?
Patient: Let me check my notes, um, I've had a spinal decompression and epidural steroids injection. 
Doctor: Who has prescribed you narcotics for this pain?
Patient: The pain is so bad, but Doctor X has handled those.
