Doctor: Mister Sunil, your blood pressure is high, and I am noticing this from past two-three times you have been here. It's been constantly high, you are not taking it seriously. 
Patient: No, nothing like that Doctor! It's been well under control. I have been monitoring at home.
Doctor: Are you noting your readings? Did you bring it with you?
Patient: No. I did not get the readings with me but I assure you I am taking care and my B P is normal.
Doctor: Well, it's up and I am little bothered by it.
