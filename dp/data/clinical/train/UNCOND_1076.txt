Doctor: Well, looking at your hand x ray, the bone looks in alignment, and I don't see any effusion.
Doctor: Any tenderness or pain?
Patient: Ah, not really!
Doctor: There is no asymmetry. Can you move your hand up and down? Now rotate it. Can you move your fingers? 
Patient: Yes, I can do all of that, no problem at all.
Doctor: Can you bend your hand?
Patient: Yes.
Doctor: Perfect.
