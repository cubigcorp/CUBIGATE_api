Doctor: Good morning, ma'am. 
Patient: Oh, good morning, doctor. 
Doctor: Please, tell me about your living situation. 
Patient: Well, right now, I live at home with my kids and my dad. 
Doctor: I see here that you're not able to go up the stairs well, can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Yeah, I can't use the stairs without holding the rail the entire time. 
Doctor: Holding the rail makes navigating the stairs easier? 
Patient: Yeah, but I still move very slow. 
Doctor: I see. Do you smoke?
Patient: Yeah, I smoke about a pack to a pack and a half a day. 
Doctor: What about exercise? Do you workout? 
Patient: No, I don't regularly workout, I've never been good at it.
