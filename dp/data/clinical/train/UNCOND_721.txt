Doctor: What's bringing her in today? 
Guest_family: Oh, doctor. She hasn't been doing well at all. 
Guest_family: I think she's actually gotten worse. 
Doctor: I understand. I'm sorry to hear that she hasn't been feeling well. Let me see what we can do for her today. 
Guest_family: I haven't taken her temperature since this morning. It was one hundred and three degrees when she woke up. 
Doctor: What time did she wake up today? 
Guest_family: Um, around eight I believe. She also suffers from apnea.
Doctor: It looks like she has an upper respiratory infection. 
Guest_family: Is she going to get better? 
Doctor: Yes, she should feel better once we start treating the infection. But I'm worried it may be pertussis.
