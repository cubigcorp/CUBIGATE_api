Patient: Hello, how are you?
Doctor: I am good, tell me what brings you here?
Patient: I am having this chest pain. I was hospitalized last year in October and at that time they put this catheter in my heart. I also underwent a heart scan. It's here in this report. 
Doctor: Yeah, I see that you got nuclear and myocardial perfusion scan, which was normal. They were looking for some heart artery lesion but then it was thought to be due to spasm.
Patient: Right.
Doctor: It is also mentioned here that you have hyperlipidemia.
Patient: Yes.
Doctor: And are you still smoking?
Patient: Yes, in fact I have been smoking actively from pass three to four days because I am really stressed.
Doctor: Hm. And would you say, you might have had some exertion recently or did some steep hiking or some cardio exercises which might have caused some additional stress on your heart causing chest pain?
Patient: No, I did not do any exertion. Just actively smoking that's all.
