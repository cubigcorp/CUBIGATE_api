Doctor: Do you drink? 
Patient: I used to drink before, but now I have stopped it completely. 
Doctor: How would you rate your pain? 
Patient: It is tolerable, like five out of ten but I do need some pain medications.
Doctor: Then why do you need more pain medications? 
Patient: Sometimes it gets hard, I really need some more pain medications. 
Doctor: Do you have morphine? Do you need more? 
Patient: I don't like morphine. Can you change it to Dilaudid? I like that medicine. That one works for me great.
