Doctor: With ten being the worst pain imaginable, out of ten, how would you describe your pain today?
Patient: I'd say its about a six out of ten today. 
Doctor: What makes the pain worse? 
Patient: It's worse when I try to walk around on it. 
Doctor: Do you have any pain at night?
Patient: No, thankfully I don't. 
Doctor: How long have you been wearing that exterior knee brace?
Patient: Oh, for a little while now.
