Doctor: Now, let's talk about your family history. Have any of them had cancer? 
Patient: Actually, yes, I know a few family members have, but I can't remember who had what kind. 
Doctor: That's okay. What about heart disease? Can you remember anyone having that? 
Patient: Yes, that rings some bells. 
Doctor: Thank you, has anyone in your family had a joint replacement? 
Patient: I know that a lot of my family has had arthritis in the past, but I can't remember whether or not they had joint replacements, honestly.
