Doctor: Good morning, ma'am. Before we begin today, can you confirm your age for me? 
Patient: Good morning, doctor. Sure, I'm seventy nine years old. 
Doctor: Great, thank you. What seems to be the problem today, ma'am? 
Patient: Well, I have this arthritis, as you know. 
Doctor: Yes, how would you describe your arthritis? 
Patient: Well, at this point I'd say it's debilitating. 
Doctor: I see, so the antiinflammatories and rest haven't helped at all? 
Patient: No, I haven't had any improvement, doctor. It's still so bad. 
Doctor: I see, I believe you'd be a good candidate for a knee replacement. 
Patient: Yes, I thought so. What are the risks of infection for the surgery? 
Doctor: Um, it's less than one percent, we use prophylactic antibiotics to control for infection the entire time. 
Patient: That's great, what about anesthesia, will I be asleep for this? 
Doctor: Yes, you won't feel a thing.
Patient: Great, yes, I'd like to do the surgery, doctor.
