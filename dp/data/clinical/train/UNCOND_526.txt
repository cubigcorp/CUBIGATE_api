Doctor: Good morning, sir, welcome to A B C D General Hospital. 
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I hope you can fix me up quickly. 
Doctor: We'll do our best. Um, before we begin, I just need some background information. So, how old are you?
Patient: I'm forty seven years old. 
Doctor: Good, and what race do you identify with?
Patient: I identify as white, sir. 
Doctor: Thank you, so, what seems to be the problem today?
Patient: Well, I have this, um, mass of my left foot, it's been getting worse too.
Doctor: I see it. How long has this tissue mass been there on that foot?
Patient: It's been about two weeks now, but it's getting worse way faster now. 
Doctor: Do you have any history of cancer?
Patient: No, but I've had an, um, shave biopsy in the past. 
Doctor: I see. 
Patient: Is there any surgery we can do for this to cut it off? I really want it gone.
