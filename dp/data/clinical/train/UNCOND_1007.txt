Doctor: Good morning, ma'am. My chart says that you're forty nine years old, and White, is that correct? 
Patient: Yes, that's all correct. 
Doctor: What do you do for a living? 
Patient: I'm a secretary. 
Doctor: Great, welcome back to the Dermatology office, do you remember when your last appointment was? 
Patient: Um, I think it was on August tenth two thousand four. 
Doctor: Good, that's what I have here as well, so has your acne improved since your last visit? 
Patient: Well, not really, and I think I have a rash too. 
Doctor: How long have you been dealing with this? 
Patient: Um, at this point it's been about two months. 
Doctor: Where do you see this rash? 
Patient: Um, it's right here, on my chest, stomach, neck, and back, it's all over my upper body. 
Doctor: I see, it appears that your acne is flaring, and there are small lesions on the follicles as well. Have you been taking your Amoxicillin and using your Tazorac? 
Patient: Yeah, I taken five hundred M G of amoxicillin twice a day, and I use the cream as well. 
Doctor: Good, the acne on your face appears to be clearing. 
Patient: Thank you, I've been out of medicine for about three days now though. 
Doctor: Okay, we might refill that. Have you had any other treatments aside from what I've done? I
Patient: Um, my husband drove me to Healing Waters and they did, um, photofacials. Is there anything that can be done in the office today, like, um, cosmetic procedures, or do you have any skin care products? I want to keep up my appearances since I work the front office as a secretary.
