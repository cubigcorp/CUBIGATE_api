Doctor: Good morning, ma'am, before we begin, how old are you?
Patient: Good morning, doctor, I'm twenty five. 
Doctor: Good, thank you. So, how are you feeling today? 
Patient: I'm okay, but I have this rash and itching over my right arm. It's so itchy and I scratch all the time. 
Doctor: Is this your dominant hand? 
Patient: Yes, so this had especially been bothering me. 
Doctor: When did you first notice these symptoms? 
Patient: Um, I think it was in October of nineteen ninety two. I think it was the twenty third. 
Doctor: Have you had any symptoms in any other parts of your body? 
Patient: Um, yeah, I've had tingling in both my legs, like in the front, and then it goes into my toes too. 
Doctor: Did this tingling sensation go away?  
Patient: Yes, it went away the next day without me doing anything. 
Doctor: Have these symptoms returned at any point? 
Patient: Well, two days later, so that'd be the twenty fifth, I noticed that my legs felt like they were asleep. I really couldn't feel anything.
Doctor: Have these symptoms spread to any other part of the body? 
Patient: Yeah, I couldn't really feel anything in the middle of my chest. I also have started having pain in my right shoulder blade. 
Doctor: Do these symptoms interfere with your ability to move? 
Patient: Yes, I don't really feel comfortable standing on my own, and I can't walk very well. 
Doctor: Do you have any cold or flu like symptoms? 
Patient: No, heat and cold don't bother me
Doctor: Do you feel any significant fatigue? 
Patient: No, not really. 
Doctor: Have you had any significant weight loss? 
Patient: No.
