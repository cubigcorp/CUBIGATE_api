Doctor: You okay there? 
Patient: Uh yeah, sorry. I'm just trying to adjust the stretcher. 
Doctor: Want some help? 
Patient: No, thank you. I think I got it. 
Doctor: So how're you doing? 
Patient: Fine, but I have this weird lump in my chest. 
Doctor: When did you first notice it? 
Patient: It's been there for a while. I'd say almost half a year. 
Doctor: Have you seen anyone for it? 
Patient: No, not until now. 
Doctor: Is it causing you pain? And has it changed in size at all?
Patient: Not really. It's just noticeable when I run my fingers over it. 
Doctor: Have you spotted any swelling or redness to the area? Any drainage? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: I see. Okay. Let me take a look and then I'll have you walk down the hall to get an Xray so we can see what's going on.
