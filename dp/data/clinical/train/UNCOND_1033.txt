Doctor: How are you feeling? 
Patient: I've been having a lot more joint pain lately. 
Doctor: You're seventy seven, correct? 
Patient: Don't remind me. 
Doctor: When did you first start experiencing joint pain? 
Patient: Couple years ago. 
Doctor: In what ways has it worsened? 
Patient: It's caused me to become less active in general. My hands and wrists aren't as mobile. 
Doctor: Have you noticed any increased swelling? 
Patient: No, but it's all gotten to be a little too uncomfortable. 
Doctor: I see here that you take the generic of Daypro. Is that helping? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: And no redness to the area, right? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: Fever or chills? 
Patient: I had diarrhea for a few days, but it's gotten much better. I was also having trouble holding my bladder. 
Doctor: Are you going to the bathroom more often, experiencing excessive thirst, or other problems?  
Patient: No. My incontinence is a bit better and so is my ankle and foot swelling. 
Doctor: How has your blood sugar been? 
Patient: A little better. 
Doctor: Have you checked your blood pressure recently? 
Patient: Not recently. 
Doctor: Any new medications? 
Patient: I'm back on Zoloft again because I think I might be depressed. Ever since losing most of my mobility, I haven't been feeling like my usual myself. I'm also sleeping all the time.
