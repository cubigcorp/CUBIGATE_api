Doctor: So, I know you're technically not allowed to drink, but I'm required to ask this anyway. Do you drink at all? 
Patient: No, actually. I try to steer clear of drinking while training for my marathon. 
Doctor: When is that by the way? 
Patient: Next summer. 
Doctor: Wow, good luck. It'll be yet another big accomplishment. 
Patient: Thank you. 
Doctor: And how about smoking of any kind? 
Patient: Nope.
