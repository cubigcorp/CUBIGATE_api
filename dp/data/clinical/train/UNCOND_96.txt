Doctor: How's she doing? 
Guest_family: She's had better days. 
Doctor: Aw and why's that? 
Guest_family: She's been really congested recently. Snorting a lot more, too. She's onlt eleven and I think it is odd she snores so much. I took her to see the allergist and he said it's not her allergies so we stopped giving her Allegra. 
Doctor: Does she happen to snore at night? 
Guest_family: No, not really. 
Doctor: Hm. 
Guest_family: And while we're here, I also wanted you to check out her toe. The right big toe appears a bit red to me. The skin around it has been peeling for the last week and a half. 
Doctor: Lemme take a look. Have you applied anything to the area?
