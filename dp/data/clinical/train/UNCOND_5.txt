Doctor: How's your asthma since you started using your inhaler again? 
Patient: Much better. I don't know why I didn't take it with me everywhere I went. 
Doctor: It's important to carry it with you, especially during times where you're exercising or walking more than usual. 
Patient: Yeah. I think I've learned my lesson. 
Doctor: Besides asthma, do you have any other medical problems?
