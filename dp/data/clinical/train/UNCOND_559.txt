Doctor: Hello, sir. How are you feeling today? 
Patient: Very itchy. I just keep scratching myself. 
Doctor: Oh, wow. I can see the rashes all over your arms. Are there rashes anywhere else? 
Patient: Yeah, it's all over my back and stomach. 
Doctor: I see it on your torso. When did this all start? 
Patient: I woke up this morning and started itching my back. After a few minutes, I noticed the rash was on my arms, chest, back, and stomach areas. 
Doctor: I'm going to take a look at the rashes and the rest of your body. 
Patient: Sounds good. 
Doctor: It looks like your face and lips are not swollen. Could you say ah for me? 
Patient: Ah. 
Doctor: It looks like your tongue isn't swollen either. 
Patient: That's good to hear. 
Doctor: Have you been feeling a shortness of breath, wheezing, or other related symptoms?
Patient: Not that I know of. 
Doctor: Sounds good. I wonder why this happened. Did you do anything the night before? 
Patient: Uh. A few days ago, I was working and had to remove some insulation. Other than that, I don't know what else could have given me these rashes. 
Doctor: I see. Do you remember being itchy after that? Did you try any new foods? 
Patient: Nope I was not itchy. Also, my diet has been the same. 
Doctor: Are you taking any new medications? 
Patient: I haven't. 
Doctor: You don't recall being exposed to any other substances? 
Patient: Not that I know of.
