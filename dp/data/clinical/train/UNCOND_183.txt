Doctor: What brings you in today? 
Patient: Um a number of different things. I don't even know where to start to be honest. 
Doctor: I understand. What's bothering you the most? 
Patient: Lemme think. I'm uh having really bad pain. 
Doctor: Where's the pain located? 
Patient: Hm. It's in a tricky spot. 
Guest_family: Hi. Husband here. Let me help explain. She's been having severe lower back pain. It started off mild and got worse over the course of a few days. She's also a lot more sluggish as a result.  
Doctor: Any recent injuries or falls? 
Guest_family: None. She spends most of her time in bed.
