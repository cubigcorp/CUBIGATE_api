Doctor: So, who is in your family?
Patient: Well, my mom, dad, and I have four brothers aged eighteen, sixteen, fourteen and twelve and I also have a younger sister. She is only three.

Patient: Yes, and we also have two dogs and two cats. 
Doctor: Okay. And everyone at home is doing fine?

Patient: Except for my mom!
Guest_family: Yeah, except for me thankfully.
