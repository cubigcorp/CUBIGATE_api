Doctor: It is nice to see you again, miss.  We are following up on a few things today. How is your arm feeling?  
Patient: My arm is all better. It is not in pain at all anymore.   
Doctor: How has your mood been? Are you feeling any relief from your symptoms since you have been on the Lexapro?  
Patient: It's helping a little bit.  
Doctor: How much Lexapro are you taking now?  
Patient: I am taking ten M G.  
Doctor: How long have you been taking the full dosage?  
Patient: About a week ago. I don't take it every day. I don't feel like I need it some days.   
Doctor: I want you to take the full dosage every day. This might be why you have not had much relief with your symptoms yet.   
Patient: Okay.   
Doctor: Your hands are a little shaky. Is this a normal occurrence for you?   
Patient: I didn't even notice.   
Doctor: It is very subtle. We will keep an eye on it for now. Your blood pressure is a little better today. Have you experienced any worsening joint or bone pain?  I want to check on your osteoporosis and osteoarthritis.
Patient: No.
