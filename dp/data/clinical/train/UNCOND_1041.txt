Doctor: Good morning, ma'am. Can you tell me more about this low back pain? 
Patient: Well, I'm not as young as I used to be, I'm fifty nine. 
Doctor: What set this pain off? Is there any injury? 
Patient: Yes, I had a fall in the beginning of two thousand six. I slipped on a freshly waxed floor. 
Doctor: What part of your lower back did you fall onto? 
Patient: I fell onto my tailbone and just general lower back. 
Doctor: Is this the only fall you've had?
Patient: No, I had another one in March of two thousand six. 
Doctor: What happened when you fell that time? 
Patient: I was trying to qualify on the gun range with a handgun, when I lost my footing. 
Doctor: What made you lose your footing?
Patient: I think it was more weakness than a loss of balance. 
Doctor: What treatments have you had for this?
Patient: Well, I've been to P T, and I had, um, cauterization of some of the nerves in my lower back.
Doctor: How many times have you had this cauterization done? 
Patient: I've had it twice, once in October and the other in November. 
Doctor: This was in two thousand eight, right? 
Patient: Correct. The P T said I have low back pain and degenerative disc disease.
