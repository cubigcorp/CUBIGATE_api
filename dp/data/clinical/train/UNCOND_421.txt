Doctor: Are you married, sir? 
Patient: Yes, I'm lucky to have, and live with my lovely wife.
Doctor: That's very nice. Did you speak with the nurse before I came in here?
Patient: Yes, she was lovely as well, I hope you're paying them well. 
Doctor: We take good care of them. They'll be happy to hear that. Let me look, she should have left me some notes, um, yep, these look good, I agree with all of this. This looks good.   
Patient: Thank you, Doctor.
