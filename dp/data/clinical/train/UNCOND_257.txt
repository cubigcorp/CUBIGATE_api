Doctor: Your son had his circumcision performed here at Children's Hospital, correct? 
Guest_family: Yes, doctor. 
Doctor: Do you remember the date of that procedure? 
Guest_family: Um, it was on September sixteenth two thousand seven. 
Doctor: Good, the procedure went well. He had some phimosis, but the operation was quite smooth otherwise. 
Guest_family: What's phimosis?
Doctor: That's tightness of the foreskin. It sometimes makes the procedure more difficult, but everything went smoothly. 
Guest_family: Oh, that's good to hear. 
Doctor: He also had a little bit of bleeding when he woke up in the recovery room, so we had to put in some additional sutures. 
Guest_family: Okay, thank you for taking care of him. 
Doctor: It's my pleasure. Has he been taking his pain medicine? 
Guest_family: He took them for a couple days, but he really seems back to normal now. He doesn't seem to be in any pain. 
Doctor: Great, does he have any difficulty urinating? 
Guest_family: No, that's normal.
Doctor: Bowel movements? How are they?
Guest_family: That's normal too, doctor.
