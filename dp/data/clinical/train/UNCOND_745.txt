Doctor: And you are-
Guest_family: Hi, I am her nurse. 
Doctor: So, do you know about her past medical history?
Guest_family: I have very limited information, as I very recently started working with her. She does have dementia and that's the main reason why I was hired. Her family wanted someone to look after her twenty four seven. 
Doctor: Oh, I see. 
Guest_family: But I do have her medical records. You can have a look.
Doctor: Yeah, that will be nice. Let me check her reports quickly. She has a history schizophrenia, chronic anemia and hypothyroidism and she also suffers from asthma. 
Guest_family: Yes. 
Doctor: Oh, I also see here she tested positive for P P D, was she diagnosed with tuberculosis? 
Guest_family: I honestly don't know, but I wasn't told that.
Doctor: Okay.
