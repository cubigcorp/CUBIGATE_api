Doctor: Do you have any history of surgeries, sir? 
Patient: The most recent was seven years ago. I had a craniotomy. I had a brain hemorrhage and there was bleed inside and outside the brain that they had to fix. 
Doctor: How was the recovery for that? 
Patient: I took a while but the doctors said I had a normal recovery time. 
Doctor: That is good. Have you had any other surgeries? 
Patient: I had surgery on my leg for a fracture. They put some pins in my leg. 
Doctor: Okay. 
Patient: I had some kind of surgery done on my stomach when I was a kid. I am not sure what the surgery was. All I know is that it was a very common procedure with no complications. 
Doctor: Okay. Is that all? 
Patient: Yep. That's it.
