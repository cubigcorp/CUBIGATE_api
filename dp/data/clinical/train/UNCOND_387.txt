Doctor: Hello. How are you feeling today?
Patient: Not so well. I went to a party last night and my chest and body have been hurting a lot. 
Doctor: I see. Did you smoke at the party? 
Patient: Nope. I never smoked in my life. 
Doctor: Great. Where on your body does it hurt? 
Patient: Like my upper right side of my stomach area. 
Doctor: I see. Did you drink alcohol last night? 
Patient: I had to drive some people home, so I was sober. I also don't like the taste of alcohol, so I stay away from it.
