Doctor: We've been following you for several conditions for a while now. What seems to be the problem today, sir? 
Patient: Um, I was peeing blood, it's back again. 
Doctor: Did you do anything that could have provoked it to come back?
Patient: No, not that I know of. 
Doctor: Have you been taking the Flomax for your B P H? 
Patient: Yes, I have been. 
Doctor: What about the Coumadin?
Patient: Yes, I've been taking that too. It has been held recently, but I ususally take it.
Doctor: Remind me, I don't have my chart with me. What conditions have you been taking the Coumadin for?
Patient: I have A F I B and stroke.
Doctor: Thank you. Isn't this your second occurrence of gross hematuria this month?
Patient: Yes, doctor.  
Doctor: Are you sure you haven't experienced any falls or anything recently? 
Patient: Yeah, actually I fell about a week ago. 
Doctor: Where is your pain from that fall? 
Patient: It's in my butt and leg. 
Doctor: Have you had your x rays taken yet? 
Patient: Yeah, the x ray tech just brought me back. 
Doctor: Okay, these x rays of the hips, knees, and ankles show severe degeneration in all areas. 
Patient: What does that mean, doctor? 
Doctor: I see some pretty significant arthritis in these areas. 
Patient: Can you tell me some good news, please? 
Doctor: Well, I don't see any fractures. 
Patient: I guess that's something. 
Doctor: When is your pain worst?
Patient: It's so severe, and it's worst first thing in the morning. 
Doctor: Okay, I know you are, but be sure to keep taking the Coumadin, that helps with the stroke and A F I B. 
Patient: Yeah, I will. I'm having problems with my sinuses today too. Can I get some nasal spray too?
