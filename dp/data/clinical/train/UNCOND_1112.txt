Doctor: So, he is Arjun, and he is thirty seven years old and was complaining of chest pain.
Patient: Hi Doctors, how are you?
Doctor: We are good thanks for asking. 
Guest_clinician: Hi there Arjun, I am doctor J and I am assisting Doctor Wilson today. So, chest pain huh? 
Patient: Yep.
Guest_clinician: And I see here no cardiac excretion was mentioned. 
Doctor: Yeah. I am suspecting coronary spasm but that's questionable. 
Guest_clinician: Okay.
Doctor: I did run a cardiac enzyme profile and it was negative. 
Guest_clinician: Alright. And he also has hyperlipidemia?
Doctor: Yes, he does.
Guest_clinician: Okay and did you order an E K G?
Doctor: I did, it is normal too. 
Guest_clinician: Don't worry Arjun, we will take of you. 
Patient: Thank you.
