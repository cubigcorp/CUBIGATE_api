Doctor: Welcome back in, Miss A. 
Patient: Thank you, doctor.
Doctor: Do you remember the information about your operation?
Patient: No, not really. Can you remind me?
Doctor: Sure, you had a lap band replacement in January of O nine, and you had a band adjustment. 
Patient: Thank you. 
Doctor: How are you feeling today? 
Patient: Well, I've been under a lot of stress lately, and I had problems with my adjustments before. 
Doctor: Has anything changed since the operation?
Patient: Actually, doctor, I was in a car accident a couple weeks ago, and I'm having problems. 
Doctor: What symptoms are you experiencing? 
Patient: I don't feel full. 
Doctor: How is your appetite? 
Patient: I'm not really hungry, but I also don't feel full. When I get hungry at night I can't wait until the morning to eat. I get so hungry. 
Doctor: Do you eat anything when you feel like this? 
Patient: Yeah, I usually have a candy bar, and that helps some.
