Doctor: Hi there! I am Doctor Smith. 
Patient: Hello! It is nice to meet you. 
Doctor: Let's start with your family medical history. 
Patient: My mother had breast cancer. My father had lung cancer that ended up taking his life. He was seventy nine when he passed. My mother also passed but not from an illness but from an infection she got after having an elective surgery.  
Doctor: I am so sorry for your loss. How old was your mother when she passed? 
Patient: Thank you. She was eighty one when she passed. I am an orphan now. My only living sibling died at forty. He had a hard life. He struggled with mental illness. 
Doctor: How did your brother pass away? 
Patient: He had pancreatitis. Oh, my dad had glaucoma. 
Doctor: You have had a lot of loss.
Patient: Yes, I have. My good friend passed away a year and a half ago. It has been a lot.  
Doctor: I have a support group I can refer you to for people to have been through loss. Would you be interested a referral, sir? 
Patient: Yes. I would like that. Thank you.
