Doctor: So, to double check, you have a history of hay fever and asthma, correct? 
Patient: Yes. I was also recently diagnosed with cervical dysplasia. I found out shortly after my last O B G Y N visit. 
Doctor: And are you planning to follow up with your O B G Y N in the upcoming months? 
Patient: Yeah, the next visit is scheduled and everything.
