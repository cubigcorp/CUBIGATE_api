Doctor: With ten being the worst pain imaginable, how would you rate your pain today out of ten, ma'am? 
Patient: Well, out of ten, I'd say it's about a seven. 
Doctor: How would you describe your pain? 
Patient: Um, I'd say it's deep, and it really aches. 
Doctor: Where is your pain located? 
Patient: It's in my right lower back, and then into my butt. 
Doctor: What activities make your surgery worse? 
Patient: I can't go up and down stairs without a lot of pain, and it hurts when I sit for a long time, like when I drive. 
Doctor: Before this pain, how would you describe your activity level? 
Patient: I was very active before all this started. 
Doctor: Are you able to do any of your prior activities? 
Patient: Not really, I'm having a lot of problems with stuff around the house, like all the chores and projects I used to be able to do.
