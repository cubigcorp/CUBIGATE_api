Doctor: My nurse tells me you're thirty four years old, is that correct? 
Patient: Yes, I just had my birthday, doctor. 
Doctor: You identify as African American, correct? 
Patient: Yes, that's right, sir.
Doctor: You're here for a follow up? What brings you back in today? 
Patient: Well, I don't really have a single acute complaint, but I have a muscle sprain in my upper back. 
Doctor: Is there an injury associated with this pain, ma'am? 
Patient: I think it has to do with me lifting weights.

Doctor: What do you do for a living? 
Patient: I'm a housekeeper, it's my profession. 
Doctor: Are you having trouble sleeping at night? 
Patient: Yes, it's not severe, but I'm having some trouble. 
Doctor: With ten being the worst pain imaginable, how would you rate your pain today? 
Patient: I'd say it's usually a two out of ten. 
Doctor: When it's the worst, how would you rate it? 
Patient: When that happens, I'd say it's a three or a four. 
Doctor: Do you take any medicines for this pain?  
Patient: Over the counter medications usually help the pain go away. 
Doctor: Do you have any other complaints? 
Patient: No, just this muscle pain. 
Doctor: Do you have any loss of balance when you hold something with this arm? 
Patient: No, my strength and everything is normal there. 
Doctor: Do you have any signs of infection? That'd be anything like fever or chills, anything like that?
Patient: No, I don't have anything like that.
