Doctor: How's it going, buddy? I haven't seen you in a long time 
Patient: Hey, Doctor. It's been a while. I've been doing well. Just here for my check up. 
Doctor: Nice. How's the family doing? Are they all well? 
Patient: Yeah, they're doing great. Nobody has been sick for a while.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Nobody has new medical conditions either, right? 
Patient: Not that I know of. They're all doing good.
