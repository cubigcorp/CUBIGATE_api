Doctor: How are you doing miss? How are your sugar numbers coming along? 
Patient: I'm doing good. Thank you. Sugar has consistently been one hundred and thirty five or under it. 
Doctor: How are you checking it? 
Patient: I have a glucose monitor at home I'm using that only. 
Doctor: Nice. Did you eat anything in the morning today? 
Patient: No, I'm fasting for my test. 
Doctor: Okay, let's see. We have an Accu Chek here in our office. I will do a quick sugar test for you, and this will be a fasting sugar test. It will be just a quick prick on your finger. 
Patient: Don't worry doctor. I'm used to poking my finger all the time. 
Doctor: Let's see what we got here. Your reading says one hundred and twenty. I will write it down for my record. Are you being active? 
Patient: Yes, I'm exercising as a rule three times every week. I don't miss it. 
Doctor: Do you feel any tingling or numbness or any kind of cramps? 
Patient: Nope. 
Doctor: Any kind of blurry vision? 
Patient: Nope. 
Doctor: Any weight loss? 
Patient: Not that I notice.
