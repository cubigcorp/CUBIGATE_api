Doctor: Have you been applying Triamcinolone zero point one percent three times a day to your rash? 
Patient: The one on my left wrist? 
Doctor: Yes. And Bactroban ointment is also three times a day as needed for your bug bites. 
Patient: Yep. 
Doctor: Are you still using Nystatin on your lips once a day as needed? 
Patient: Uh yeah. I've been using it much less now. 
Doctor: So let's see, your other medications are the same as of July thirtieth O four with the exception of Klonopin?  
Patient: Yeah, I mean I'm taking four M G in the morning and six M G at night instead of the six M G and eight M G that was recommended. I feel like I do better with the lower doses.
