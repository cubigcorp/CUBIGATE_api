Doctor: How're you feeling today? 
Patient: Much better. The antibiotics seemed to really help. 
Doctor: Are you still experiencing any symptoms? 
Patient: Um no, thankfully. I had some wheezing when I first started the antibiotics, but it's improved a ton. I don't think the wheeze is even there anymore. 
Doctor: Good, good.
