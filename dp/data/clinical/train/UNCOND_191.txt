Doctor: Do you smoke, sir? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: Do you drink? 
Patient: No. I was a boxer before so that's why I was always stayed away from these things. 
Doctor: How is your living condition? Are you living alone or with family? 
Patient: Mostly I'm by myself during the daytime. Family comes to help with me on and off. I just love it that way. I wasn't to be in an independent home setting soon.
