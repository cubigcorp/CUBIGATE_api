Doctor: Good evening, and welcome to A B C D General Hospital E D. 
Patient: Thank you, Doctor, I've really messed up this ankle. 
Doctor: Before we begin, how old are you? And which gender do you identify?
Patient: Thank you for asking, Doctor, I'm a fifty year old man. 
Doctor: Thank you, what happened? 
Patient: I fell off my liner, and I landed right onto my left foot. 
Doctor: How far did you fall? 
Patient: Um, it was really about ten feet. 
Doctor: Oh, yes, I see. I have some good news for you, there's no gross deformity in this ankle.
Patient: What does that mean, exactly? 
Doctor: I don't see any ankle dislocation, which is good. 
Patient: Oh, that's good news. 
Doctor: Have you had your x rays taken yet?
Patient: Yeah, the tech just brought me back. 
Doctor: Great, let me pull them up here. Okay, um, if you look here, you'll see a fracture of your talus. 
Patient: Which bone is that?
Doctor: That's your heel, to be specific, it's a grade I V Hawkins fracture of the left talus. You are still neurovascularly intact in the distal region. 
Patient: What are we going to do about this? 
Doctor: Do you have any other pain from the fall, aside from the ankle?
Patient: No, the ankle really took all of the weight of the fall. 
Doctor: Okay, I think we should do surgery in order to repair this ankle. 
Patient: Why is that?
Doctor: There is very weak blood flow to the body of this bone, there's a risk for avascular necrosis, which is bone death. 
Patient: Okay, you're right. What are the risks of this infection with this surgery?
Doctor: Overall, the risks of infection are less than one percent. We'll use antibiotics to keep everything clean. 
Patient: Will I be asleep for this?
Doctor: Yes, you'll be under anesthesia.
Patient: Okay, yes, um, I'd like to go forward with the surgery.
