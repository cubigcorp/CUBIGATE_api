Doctor: Welcome to the clinic, sir. 
Patient: Thank you. 
Doctor: Let us start with your medical history. 
Patient: I used to have seizures, but they have stopped now. 
Doctor: Was there a cause of the seizures? 
Patient: About seven years ago I had a traumatic stroke. They told me I had bleeding in the brain. After the stroke I was left with this weakness on my right side. 
Doctor: What part of your body is affected by the weakness? 
Patient: My arm, hand, and my face. 
Doctor: Do you have any other health problems? 
Patient: My liver is falling. It is because of all the alcohol that I have consumed over the years. I am not drinking anymore. 
Doctor: Are you being treated for your liver disfunctions? 
Patient: No. I just stopped drinking. I think I have diabetes. 
Doctor: What makes you feel like you have diabetes? 
Patient: I have been really thirsty, and I have been having numbness and tingling in my feet. 
Doctor: Oh okay. We can definitely do some test today to find out if you are diabetic or not.
