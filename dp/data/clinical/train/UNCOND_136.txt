Doctor: Now that you're eighteen, I have a big question to ask you. Do you smoke? 
Patient: Never have, never will. 
Doctor: That's what I like to hear. You have a good head on your shoulders, bud. 
Patient: Thanks. I'd like to think so, too. I have some friends who smoke weed, but stay clear of tobacco.
