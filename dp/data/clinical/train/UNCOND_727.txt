Doctor: Remind me, how did he hurt himself?
Guest_family_1: He was riding quads on October tenth two thousand seven when he got thrown off. 
Doctor: Yes, and we did O R I F on his fracture dislocation of the left elbow. 
Guest_family_1: Yes, he also fractured the neck of his right glenoid, um, if I remember correctly. 
Doctor: Which hand does he write with? 
Guest_family_1: He writes with his right hand. 
Doctor: Okay. That fracture appears to have healed very well; kids generally heal pretty well. How does it feel today? 
Guest_family_1: Yes, he's only ten. He's been pretty stiff, so he's been going to P T, and using his Dynasplint.
Doctor: That's good that he is already in P T. His left elbow fracture is healed, so we should do another surgery in order to remove that hardware. That may help decrease some of the irritation with elbow extension. He looks neurologically intact in terms of movement and reflexed in his wrist and hand. 
Guest_family_1: Yes, I agree. What is the risk of infection of this surgery? 
Doctor: Historically, the risk of infection is less than one percent. 
Guest_family_1: Oh, wow, that's low, how is that possible? 
Doctor: We'll use prophylactic antibiotics, this controls for infection, and helps keep everything clean. Other Risks include bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to remove hardware, failure to relieve pain, and continued postoperative stiffness.
Guest_family_1: Wow, that's great, will be he asleep the entire time? 
Doctor: Yes, we'll use anesthesia, he won't feel a thing. 
Guest_family_1: Will this fix his pain, for sure?
Doctor: I can't guarantee it, he may still be in some pain. 
Guest_family_1: Okay, what about you, dear? What do you think?
Guest_family_2: Yeah, I think we should do it, boys should be playing sports with their friends.
