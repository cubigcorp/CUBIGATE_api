Doctor: We can release you from the hospital today if we have a safe place for you to go. Is there a parent or guardian we can release you to?  
Patient: I am in foster care. My foster mom is going out of town on the nineteenth to the twenty third.  
Doctor: In that case, we will have to keep you in the hospital until your foster mom returns from her trip.  
Patient: Can my mom and grandmother come and visit me here on Thursday? That is the day they usually come to visit me at my foster home.  
Doctor: Yes. I think we can make some arrangements to make that happen.
