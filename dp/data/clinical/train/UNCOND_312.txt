Doctor: So we're here to follow up on a few things. I'd like to know how you're keeping up with your blood sugar checks. 
Patient: I've been checking my blood sugar one to two times a day. 
Doctor: Have you been keeping a log? 
Patient: Uh yeah, but I need to be better at it. 
Doctor: Do you have the log with you today? 
Patient: Yep, in fact it's right here. Let me grab it for you. 
Doctor: Great. 
Patient: Here ya go. 
Doctor: Thank you. And have you been watching your cholesterol intake since getting blood work done? Your labs show your cholesterol levels are a bit elevated. I'd like for you to monitor your cholesterol and go in for another set of labs before our next visit. 
Patient: Do I need to fast for it again? 
Doctor: Yes, you'll need to fast. I'd recommend going in early in the morning before eating any breakfast.  
Patient: That sounds like a good plan. 
Doctor: And as for your sinusitis, how have you been feeling since finishing your course of antibiotics? 
Patient: Much better. No more headaches and a stuffy nose.
