Doctor: Good afternoon, young man. 
Patient: Hello, doctor. 
Doctor: How old are you, young man?
Patient: I'm thirteen, sir.
Doctor: Thank you, so, what happened?
Patient: I sliced my right ring finger with a piece of glass while I was playing around with my friends. 
Doctor: You need to be more careful, young man. What kind of symptoms do you feel in that finger?
Patient: You're right. I have a lot of, um, numbness and tingling in it.
