Guest_family: He is coughing for one week now.
Doctor: How about any congestion? Is it one week or more?
Guest_family: No did I say that? I meant two to three weeks. I am so worried. He is just one year.  
Doctor: Don't worry let me see, can you tell me everything from the beginning?
Guest_family: Sure. It started off as a congestion, but then he started coughing about a week ago and it is getting worse.
Doctor: Okay, what else?
Guest_family: Actually, he had Pop Can just three days ago and I never found the top of that and was wondering if he had swallowed that.
Doctor: It is possible, have you seen any change in his breathing?
Guest_family: His breathing has not gotten worse since that happened.
Doctor: Any fever?
Guest_family: No. No fever.
Doctor: Okay.
