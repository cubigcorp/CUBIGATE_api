Doctor: How old is your son? 
Guest_family: He is almost five and a half years old now. 
Doctor: What seems to be the problem? 
Guest_family: He has a lot of pain about both feet, and if you look at it, it looks like his feet rotate inwards. 
Doctor: Okay, let me see, okay, um, he has rocker bottom feet.  
Guest_family: Okay. 
Doctor: I believe he would benefit from a subtalar arthrodesis, possible autograft, and lengthening of the Achilles. I'll go over the details of that procedure right now. 
Guest_family: Can we do the surgery soon?
Doctor: Yes we can. But we'll probably need to do another procedure until his foot matures some more.   This is a stabilizing measure.
Guest_family: What are the risks of infection if we do the surgery? 
Doctor: Historically, the risk of infection is very low, usually less than one percent. 
Guest_family: How do you get the risk so low? 
Doctor: We use prophylactic antibiotics to minimize the infection risk. 
Guest_family: Will he be able to walk again right after the surgery? 
Doctor: No, he'll need to stay off it for a while, we call this nonweightbearing. It will only be for some time after the procedure, it's not permanent.  
Guest_family: What are the rest of the risks?
Doctor: The total risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time. I would not worry about these risks, though. The risk is low. 
Guest_family: Okay. Let's do the surgery.
