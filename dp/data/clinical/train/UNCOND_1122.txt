Doctor: Do you live alone? 
Patient: I do. I lost my husband to prostate cancer last year. 
Doctor: Oh wow. I'm so deeply sorry for your loss. Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult. I lost my sister to cervical cancer two years ago. It was one of the hardest experiences of my life. 
Patient: I'm sorry for your loss as well. It helps to remember the positive memories you had with them.  
Doctor: Yes, definitely. How have you been doing otherwise? 
Patient: Not bad. I've been keeping myself busy with gardening. 
Doctor: Gardening is a great hobby. 
Patient: Yes, I enjoy it very much. It brings me a lot of peace. 
Doctor: And as your doctor I have to ask, but any history of alcohol or drug use? 
Patient: No.
