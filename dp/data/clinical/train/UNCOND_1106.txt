Doctor: Hi there! I am Doctor Kirkland.
Patient: Hi. 
Doctor: How are you feeling? 
Patient: I feel weird. Like I feel confused. I don't know how I got here. 
Doctor: That's okay. Do you remember what happened to you before you came here? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: Can you tell me about your past medical history? 
Patient: Um.
Doctor: Take your time. 
Patient: I can't think of what it is called. It's something to do with my brain. 
Doctor: Okay. 
Patient: My doctor knows what it is. 
Doctor: What is the name of your doctor? 
Patient: Doctor Frank. 
Doctor: Doctor X? Across the street? 
Patient: Yes, that is his name. I don't know if that is across the street or not. 
Doctor: I will have your nurse give him a call and get some background information from him. 
Patient: Okay. 
Doctor: Can you please give Doctor X a call and get mister Jones' medical history? 
Guest_clinician: Yes, of course. 
Doctor: Thank you.
