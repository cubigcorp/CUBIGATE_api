Doctor: Good morning, sir. You're sixty one years old, correct? 
Patient: Good morning, doctor. Yes, that's correct. 
Doctor: Great, and you identify as Caucasian, right? 
Patient: Yes, that's correct as well. 
Doctor: Thank you, do you have any medical conditions that I should know about? 
Patient: Yes, I have diabetes. 
Doctor: How are you handling your diabetes?
Patient: Well, I've had diabetes for a long time but had never been treated for it.
Doctor: Okay, thank you for telling me. What seems to be the problem today? 
Patient: I've been working in my garage over the past few days, and I have this redness and swelling in my right foot. 
Doctor: Do you have any itchiness or pain?
Patient: Yes, and it's getting worse. 
Doctor: Have you seen any other doctors about this? 
Patient: Um, yes. I went to the A B C D General Hospital E R and they gave me an evaluation there. 
Doctor: Do you have any images from this visit? 
Patient: Um, yes. I have them right here. 
Doctor: Okay, these show a foreign body in the foot. 
Patient: But what about all the stuff on the outside of my foot?
Doctor: Well, that's consistent with cellulitis. 
Patient: What's that?
Doctor: It's a skin infection we clean it up in surgery.
Patient: What kind of procedure can we do? 
Doctor: We should do an irrigation debridement for the cellulitis, and remove the foreign body. I think that will really help. 
Patient: Yes, I agree, doctor.
