Doctor: Have you seen your lab results? 
Patient: No, do you have those in today? 
Doctor: Yes, I have them right here. They're essentially negative, except it appears that you had C difficile in the past. Do you remember that?
Patient: Yes, I got it when I worked at a hospital after graduating. 
Doctor: Yeah, its unfortunately more common there.
