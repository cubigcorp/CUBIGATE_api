Doctor: Let's go over your history.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: I see that you had an appendectomy.
Patient: Back in the nineteen forties. I also had an ankle resection in nineteen seventy five.
Doctor: Any complications with either surgery?
Patient: Uh nope.
Doctor: I also see that you have a recurring history of pneumonia.
Patient: Yeah. Started around age twenty and stuck with me ever since.
Doctor: How often have you had pneumonia?
Patient: Once every five years or so.
Doctor: Have you ever been hospitalized due to pneumonia?
Patient: Uh I'm usually given antibiotics and then discharged. 
Doctor: I see.
Patient: Unfortunately, I've had more episodes in the past year than ever before.
Doctor: Any history of inherited lung disease, bronchiectasis, or other chronic pulmonary cause for repeated pneumonia?
Patient: Not to my knowledge. 
Doctor: And you recently saw the urologist, correct?
Patient: Yes. I had a catheter placed for urinary retention. He told me he thinks it's due to an enlarged prostate.
Doctor: Do you have a history of diabetes or other medical problems?
Patient: Uh no. I've lost about eighteen pounds in the last month but other than that everything else seems to be fine.
