Doctor: Do you live close to the office, or did you have to drive a long way here? 
Patient: I live right around here, I'm a local girl. 
Doctor: Good, are you working right now?
Patient: Yes, doctor, I work full time. 
Doctor: That's good, sometimes it's nice to stay busy. Is there any history of drug or alcohol abuse I should know about? 
Patient: No, absolutely not, doctor.
