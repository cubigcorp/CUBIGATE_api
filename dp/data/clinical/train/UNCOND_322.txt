Patient: Oh, I am fifty eight now. 
Doctor: So, you are here today because you are having some vision difficulties? Tell me about what has been going on, ma'am. 
Patient: Yeah. Okay. It all started a year ago. It started with losing the color in my vision. 
Doctor: Was the loss sudden or gradual? 
Patient: Gradual. And now I am starting to have blurry vision. 
Doctor: When did that start happening? 
Patient: I noticed it two months ago. 
Doctor: Is the blurred vision an all blur or is there a blind spot of blurred vision. 
Patient: It is an all over vision blur and then I have on blind spot in my right eye. 
Doctor: Have you had any fluctuations in your symptoms in the last year? Have you gained any vision back? 
Patient: Some days I feel like things are a little better but not much. I have basically been the same. 
Doctor: Have you experienced any weakness, dizziness, vertigo, nausea or vomiting? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: Any double vision or headaches? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: Any pain in or behind the eye at all?
Patient: No. 
Doctor: Any other health concerns or complains? 
Patient: No. Just the vision problems.
