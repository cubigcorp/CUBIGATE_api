Doctor: Where's your pain? 
Patient: Right above my belly button. It's been bothering me for three weeks now.  
Doctor: Does the pain come and go? 
Patient: Um it's pretty constant, but it does seem to get worse at night. 
Doctor: Do you find that sitting or laying down in certain positions helps the pain? 
Patient: Eh not really. I can't seem to really get comfortable since it started. 
Doctor: Have you taken any medicine for the pain? 
Patient: I uh- 
Doctor: Yes? 
Patient: Um I took Pepto Bismol a few times, but that didn't do much. 
Doctor: Did they already take you back for your C T scan? 
Patient: Yeah. 
Doctor: We should be getting the results of your scan fairly soon then. In the meantime, I'm going to put in some additional orders.
