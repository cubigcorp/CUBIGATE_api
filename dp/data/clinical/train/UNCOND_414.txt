Doctor: How long have you been feeling weakness and fatigue? 
Patient: Well, I'd say it's been a lot worse this week. I haven't had much of an appetite either. 
Doctor: Have you lost weight as a result? 
Patient: I've lost about eight pounds, which is the most I've ever lost in a week's time. 
Doctor: Wow, that's concerning. Are you experiencing any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: How about chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, or heart racing? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: Any neurological symptoms, such as numbness or tingling? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: We'll get to the bottom of this. I'm waiting for your lab report to come back and then we can figure out the next steps.
