Doctor: My chart here says that you're eighty three years old, is that correct, ma'am? 
Patient: Yes doctor, that's correct, I just had my birthday. 
Doctor: Happy belated birthday! How have you been doing since your last visit?
Patient: Well, my cancer hasn't needed phlebotomies for several months now, which is good. 
Doctor: That's great, you have been treated for polycythemia vera, correct? 
Patient: Yes, that's the one. 
Doctor: I also see you're unassisted today, which is also great. 
Patient: Yeah, having some independence is nice.
