Doctor: Good afternoon, ma'am. Welcome to A B C D General Hospital. Before we begin, I just need to confirm some background information on you. 
Patient: Good afternoon, doctor. Absolutely, that's no problem. 
Doctor: First, how old are you?
Patient: I'm nineteen, sir. 
Doctor: Good, and your chart says you identify as Caucasian. Is that correct? 
Patient: Yes, sir, that's correct. 
Doctor: Great, what seems to be problem today, ma'am?
Patient: I've had this bunion on my foot for such a long time. 
Doctor: How long has this bunion been present? 
Patient: At this point, um, I don't even remember how long it's been. 
Doctor: Do you have any other conditions that I should be aware of?
Patient: Actually, yes. I have a history of, um, Charcot Marie tooth disease. 
Doctor: That's good to know, thank you. 
Patient: I would like to have surgery to cut this bunion off, I can't take it anymore.
