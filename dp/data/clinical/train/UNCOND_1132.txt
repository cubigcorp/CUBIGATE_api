Doctor: Hi there how are you?
Patient: I am good no problem at all other than the usual.
Doctor: And what is that?
Patient: You know, some discomfort I have on my right side. I have been feeling that since I had a stroke five years back.
Doctor: Right, right. We did an E M G right? 
Patient: Yes.
Doctor: And none of the medications we tried are helping?
Patient: No, I also saw a neurologist, but nothing is helping
Doctor: Okay, and are you monitoring your sugar regularly?
Patient: Oh yes, Everyday at least two to three times a day.
Doctor: And how bout insulin dose? 
Patient: Oh, that I kind of adjust myself. 
Doctor: Well, I have rechecked all the symptoms and everything looks fine. I don't see anything out of order, but we will keep monitoring. 
Patient: Okay. 
Doctor: And you are not smoking or drinking again are you? 
Patient: No, not since I had the stroke.
Doctor: In the past you had a history of heavy usage of both alcohol and smoking, you need to be careful. You are seventy years old. 
Patient: Yeah, I am taking care of it. 
Doctor: Alright take care then.
