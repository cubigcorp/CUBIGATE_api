Doctor: Good, are you having any chest pain? 
Patient: No sir, I stopped using my nitroglycerin too. 
Doctor: Good, are you having any fever or chills? 
Patient: No, nothing like that. 
Doctor: Are you having any pain with urination, or blood in the urine? 
Patient: No, nothing like that, sir, everything is normal.
Doctor: How often do you urinate during the day? 
Patient: I go about every three hours or so, I have a good stream and everything. 
Doctor: Do you wake up at night to go to the bathroom?
Patient: No, I sleep through the night very well.
Doctor: Good, do you have any other conditions that I should know about? 
Patient: Well, I have a history of elevated P S A, and I had a biopsy in June when I had a, um, high grade P I N. 
Doctor: Do you know what that P S A value was? 
Patient: It was eleven point six. 
Doctor: Thank you, I see here on Doctor X's notes that there were two specimens that were too small to evaluate.
