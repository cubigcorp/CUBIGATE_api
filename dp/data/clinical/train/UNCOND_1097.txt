Doctor: How old are you? 
Patient: I'm eighty six years old. 
Doctor: What gender do you identify with? 
Patient: I identify as a female. 
Doctor: How long have you had this back and buttock pain? 
Patient: Its been a while, now. I know I have a fracture in my lower back. 
Doctor: How have you been managing this? 
Patient: Another doctor called this conservative treatment. I've been resting a lot, and using antiinflammatories. 
Doctor: Has there been any improvement?
Patient: Its been several months at this point, and honestly no, there's been no improvement. I'm still in a lot of pain.  
Doctor: This C T Scan you had recently shows sclerosis, with some healing of a L five compression fracture, but if you look here, the healing is not complete. 
Patient: What can we do about this? I'm in so much pain. 
Doctor: I believe you'd be a candidate for a bilateral L five kyphoplasty. 
Patient: What's that? 
Doctor: It's a small procedure on that L five vertebra. Its minimally invasive, and we can actually do it as an outpatient procedure. 
Patient: Oh, wow, that's good to hear. What are the risks of infection?
Doctor: Very low, historically, they're less than one percent. 
Patient: How is this possible? 
Doctor: We'll use antibiotics in order to control for infection. 
Patient: That's great, will I be under anesthesia?
Doctor: Yes, you'll be asleep for the whole thing. 
Patient: Great, yes, I'd like to have this done, I can't keep living in this pain. 
Doctor: Awesome, I agree. Do you have control over your bladder and bowel movements? 
Patient: Yes, thankfully, I have complete control over everything like that still. 
Doctor: Do you wear a brace or corset normally?
Patient: Yes, I usually wear both. 
Doctor: Okay, last question, can you notice any weakness in your body? 
Patient: No, I'm still very strong, even at my age.
