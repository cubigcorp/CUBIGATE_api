Doctor: I see here that Doctor- 
Patient: Yes, Doctor X referred me. My thyroid is an absolute mess. I have never been in so much pain in my seventy one years. 
Doctor: I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope we're able to get you the care that you need. 
Patient: I've been coughing up a storm. It's gotten to be way too enlarged. 
Doctor: It's good that you're here today to get the surgery rolling. 
Patient: I signed the paperwork and everything. 
Doctor: I'll go over the risk and benefits one more time. Any questions for me?
Patient: When is the earliest I can get this done again? 
Doctor: Given your symptoms, I'd like to get you in in the next few days.
