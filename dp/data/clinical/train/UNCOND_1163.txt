Doctor: Hello, miss. How are you feeling today? 
Patient: Terrible. My allergies are killing me right now. 
Doctor: Do you have a history of allergies? 
Patient: Yeah, I do. I had them all the time when I lived in Seattle, but they got a lot worse when I moved here. I am a strong German woman and I hate how something as little as allergies gets the best of me. 
Doctor: Why did you move here? 
Patient: I wanted to experience different cities since I'm only twenty three. 
Doctor: That sounds exciting. Back to your allergies now. Do you take any medication to relieve your symptoms? 
Patient: Here's a list of past and current medications I'm taking. 
Doctor: Thank you. Let me take a look. I see you took Claritin and Zyrtec in the past, correct? Did those help you? 
Patient: Yeah, that's correct. They were working for a bit, but then they stopped working after a while. 
Doctor: I see. Your notes say you took Allegra after, correct? 
Patient: Correct. I tried out Allegra last summer, but I don't know if it was doing its job. I tried it again two weeks ago because my allergies were getting bad, but it still didn't work. 
Doctor: I see. Your notes state you've tried some nasal sprays, correct? 
Patient: Yeah, I did. I wanted to see if they would work. 
Doctor: Were you prescribed these nasal sprays? 
Patient: Nope. I bought them at my local pharmacy. 
Doctor: Sounds good. I'm looking at your medical history, and it sates here you have asthma too, correct? 
Patient: Yeah, I've had it for a long time, but it hasn't gotten worse. 
Doctor: I see. Do you think you need any medication to help alleviated your asthma? 
Patient: No. It doesn't bother me as much as my allergies.
