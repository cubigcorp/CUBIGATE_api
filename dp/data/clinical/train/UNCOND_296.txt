Doctor: Good afternoon, young man. Is this your mother? 
Patient: Hi, doctor. Yes, this is my mom. 
Doctor: Good, can you tell me more about your son, ma'am?
Guest_family: Sure, well, he's six years old now, and we're here to follow up his A D H D medicines. 
Doctor: He's been taking Adderall, correct? How long has he been taking this?
Guest_family: It's been about a month now. 
Doctor: How has he responded to the Adderall?
Guest_family: The first day he took it, truthfully, he was wonderful. There's been a lot of improvement in his behavior, and he's really been doing well, so far. 
Doctor: That's great!
Guest_family: Yes, but I have two concerns. When he takes the medicine first thing in the morning it seems to take a while to kick in, and then it wears off at about two P M and he has problems in the evening. 
Doctor: Has he had problems with his appetite? 
Guest_family: Um, he did at first, but it's been coming back. It's more of a problem in the morning when he first takes the medicine in the morning, not so much in the afternoon after it wears off. 
Doctor: Have you gotten any reports from his teachers? 
Guest_family: They have seen a dramatic improvement with it. 
Doctor: Has he taken every dose?
Guest_family: Well, I missed one last weekend, and he was just horrible. 
Patient: Yeah, mommy, I thought I needed it, but you didn't give it to me.
