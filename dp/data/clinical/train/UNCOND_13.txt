Doctor: Any past medical history? 
Guest_family: She has a history of peptic ulcer disease and we think she may have had a possible stroke three or four years ago. I would have to double check. 
Doctor: Let me see if I can find it in her records.  
Doctor: Does she see a neurologist? 
Guest_family: Um I'm not sure. I can call her son? 
Doctor: Yes, if you could find out that'd be great.  
Guest_family: She's also experiencing some memory loss as of one to two years ago. I think that's it for medical history.
