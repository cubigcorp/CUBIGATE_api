Doctor: Looks like you have a U T I and I need to give you some antibiotics to treat it.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: I will write you a prescription for Macrobid. Are you still using the Walgreens pharmacy at Thrashers Corner?
Patient: Yes.   
Doctor: Are you taking any other medications? 
Patient: Yes, I am taking quite a few. I always carry the list of my medications, let me tell you the names.  Yeah, so I take Dilantin for my seizures, Toprol for my high blood pressure and Pravachol for my cholesterol.
Doctor: Pravachol for my cholesterol. Wow, thank you for that, it helps a lot. Let me make a note of it.
Patient: Sure.
