Doctor: How's your husband doing? 
Patient: He's good. He usually comes with me to my appointments, but he had to run some errands this morning. 
Doctor: Happy to hear that he's also doing well.  
Patient: Me too.  
Doctor: I just have one more question for you regarding your social history. Do you smoke? 
Patient: No, never. 
Doctor: Okay, so no changes.
