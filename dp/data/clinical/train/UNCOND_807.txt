Doctor: Good afternoon, how old are you? 
Patient: Hello Doctor, I'm fifty four years old. 
Doctor: What gender do you identify with? 
Patient: I identify as a female. 
Doctor: Thank you. What symptoms are you experiencing in your right hand? 
Patient: I have numbness and tingling in my right hand. 
Doctor: Are there any specific fingers that you feel it in?
Patient: I really feel it in my fifth, fourth, and third fingers.
Doctor: What kind of treatments have you done for this pain? 
Patient: I've taken antiinflammatories, stayed away from sports and stuff like that, and rested. 
Doctor: Has this helped at all?
Patient: No, not at all, its still numb and tingling. 
Doctor: This sounds like carpal tunnel, there's a quick, minimally invasive surgery I can do on this hand, since it hasn't responded to nonoperative treatments. I think that'll really help. 
Patient: I'd like to do that, what's the name of the procedure?  
Doctor: Its called a carpal tunnel release.
