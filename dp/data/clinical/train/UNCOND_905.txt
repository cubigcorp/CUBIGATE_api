Doctor: Hello, miss. How are you doing today? 
Patient: I have this massive headache. 
Doctor: I see. Do migraines usually run in your family? 
Patient: They do. Everyone has it. We've been having it for many years. 
Doctor: Oh, wow. I'm looking at your blood reports, and it shows you have high blood sugar. Does diabetes run in your family too?
Patient: Yup. We all eat too much rice for dinner.
