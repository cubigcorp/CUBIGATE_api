Doctor: Good morning, sir, I hear you're a patient of Doctor A. 
Patient: Yes, that's correct. 
Doctor: Did she refer you to me?
Patient: Yeah, I'm fifty five, so I'm not too young anymore, but I have developed iron deficiency anemia with blood in my stool. At least, that's what she's told me so far.  
Doctor: Are you having diarrhea?
Patient: Yeah, I am.
Doctor: How would you describe the frequency?
Patient: I'd say it's chronic at this point. 
Doctor: How long have you known you have anemia? 
Patient: Um, it's been a few months now. 
Doctor: What markers were evaluated in order to diagnose this? 
Patient: I had, um, an unusual pruritus, and I had a C B C. 
Doctor: Do you have the results of that? 
Patient: Yes, right here. 
Doctor: Thank you, so this shows a hemoglobin of nine, and M C V of sixty five. 
Patient: Are those high? 
Doctor: Well, actually, both of those are low. 
Patient: Oh, okay. 
Doctor: How long have you had blood in your stool?
Patient: Um, it's been about five months now.
Doctor: What has the color been like?
Patient: Well, it's been both dark and bright blood, actually? 
Doctor: When was your last colonoscopy?
Patient: It was about three years ago, I had it with Doctor X. I did it in Las Cruces. 
Doctor: Was there any abnormality found? 
Patient: Yeah, I had polyps removed. 
Doctor: Were those polyps evaluated?
Patient: Yeah, the doctors said they were, um, hyperplastic. They diagnosed me with, um, lymphocytic colitis. 
Doctor: I see, when was the last time you were treated for diarrhea? 
Patient: At this point, it's been more than three years.
