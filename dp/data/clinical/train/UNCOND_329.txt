Doctor: Hello. Looks like we are here for a six months follow up. How are we doing?
Patient: I have stayed relatively the same. My main complaint is that I feel tired throughout the day. The C P A P is doing fine and I wake up refreshed, but I don't like how I crash. 
Doctor: Alright. How are the thyroid issues?
Patient: I seem to be fine. My thyroid gland does not seem enlarged and I can breathe like normal. No fever or anything. 
Doctor: Have you experienced any of the following: temperature intolerance, palpitations, muscle weakness, tremors, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea?
Patient: Nothing of the kind. 
Doctor: How has you weight been?
Patient: It has been stable. 
Doctor: Any muscle weakness closest to the body's center?
Patient: No, nothing like that. Not bad for forty five.
