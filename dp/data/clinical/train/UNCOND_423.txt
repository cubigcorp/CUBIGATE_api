Doctor: How're you doing today? 
Patient: Overall, pretty good. 
Doctor: Any plans for the weekend? 
Patient: No, not really. Just dog sitting my friend's golden. 
Doctor: Gotcha. That's still nice. We used to have a golden when I was a kid. They're the sweetest dogs. 
Patient: They are very sweet. 
Doctor: Okay, so you're in for a follow up for your neck and back pain. 
Patient: Yessir.  
Doctor: Have you been going to pain management? 
Patient: Yeah, I go once every week or so.  
Doctor: How's your pain now? 
Patient: Manageable, I guess.  
Doctor: Is the pain still keeping you up at night? 
Patient: Not like it used to.  
Doctor: Good, great to hear.
