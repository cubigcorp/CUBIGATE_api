Doctor: How's your jaw doing? 
Patient: The pain seems to have gotten worse. 
Doctor: Do you mind if I take a look? 
Patient: Sure. Ow, ow, ow. That's the spot that hurts the most. What's causing it? 
Doctor: It's hard to say, but I'm thinking it could be T M J. I'd like to get you in to see a T M J specialist.
