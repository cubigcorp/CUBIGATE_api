Doctor: Do you have any medical problems? 
Patient: Let's see. I have diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and osteoporosis.  
Doctor: And any surgeries? 
Patient: Several. 
Doctor: Which ones? 
Patient: I had my tonsils taken out when I was a kid. I also had my uterus removed along with my ovaries and fallopian tubes. The list goes on. I had my appendix removed and two or three of my parathyroids taken out. Despite getting some of my parathyroids removed, I still have borderline high calcium levels according to my endocrinologist. 
Doctor: Did you experience any complications during or after surgery? 
Patient: No. I forgot to mention that I had two carpel tunnel releases as well.
