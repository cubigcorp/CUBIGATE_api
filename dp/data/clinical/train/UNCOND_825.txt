Doctor: Can you confirm your age for me, ma'am? 
Patient: Sure, I'm fifty six years old. 
Doctor: Great, so what brings you in to see me today? 
Patient: Um, I'm peeing a lot, and I'm having  a little bit blood in that urine as well. 
Doctor: Have you ever had a cystoscopy? 
Patient: Yes, it was unremarkable, that's what they told me. 
Doctor: When are your episodes for the most part? 
Patient: Um, usually during the day. I don't usually have them at night.
Doctor: Are you having any pain with urination? 
Patient: No, no pain. 
Doctor: Aside from the little bit of blood, can you tell if there's any pus in your urine? 
Patient: No, I don't have any of that, it's just the little bit of blood. 
Doctor: Have you taken any medications for this? 
Patient: Um, I had Ditropan, and it didn't do very well. 
Doctor: Well, this ultrasound of the kidney is also unremarkable, so at this time I think we should try a different medication.
