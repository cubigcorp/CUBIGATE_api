Patient: Good afternoon, doctor. 
Doctor: Remind me, please, how old are you?
Patient: I'm sixty nine years old, doctor. 
Doctor: Thank you, what seems to be the problem today?
Patient: Oh, I've had pain in these knees for years, but it's been getting a lot worse over the last few months. 
Doctor: Is the pain messing with your ability to do activities? 
Patient: Absolutely, sir, yes it is. 
Doctor: What kind of treatments have you had so far? 
Patient: Another doctor called it conservative treatment, um, I've taken antiinflammatories and had some injections. 
Doctor: Do you remember what kind of injections you've had? 
Patient: It was, um, cortisone, and Synvisc. 
Doctor: Did these relieve the pain at all? 
Patient: Well, it was only a temporary relief. Is there anything else we can do?
Doctor: Well, there is surgery for this.
Patient: What are the risks of infection from the surgery?
Doctor: Historically, it's less than one percent. 
Patient: How is this possible? 
Doctor: We use prophylactic antibiotics in order to eliminate the risk.
Patient: That's great, I've heard of D V T from the commercials, is there a risk for that?
Doctor: There's a risk, but it's low. Other risks are pulmonary embolism, need for further surgery, and further pain.
Patient: Okay, yes, I'd like to do the surgery.
