Doctor: It looks like you have an extensive medical history. 
Patient: I blame my heart. It's caused me the most trouble. I had coronary artery bypass surgery in twenty ten along with an angioplasty. 
Doctor: I'm sorry that your heart has been giving you so much trouble. I'm happy that you're here with us today and taking the right measures to keep yourself healthy. 
Patient: Oh, and I forgot to mention that I've had prostate biopsies in the past. 
Doctor: When did you have the biopsies done? 
Patient: Last year. 
Doctor: Did they come back negative? 
Patient: Yes, fortunately. I guess my prostate isn't as troublesome as my heart. 
Doctor: I understand.
