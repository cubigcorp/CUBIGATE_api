Doctor: I want to go over your medical history. I see here you saw the dermatologist a month ago.
Patient: Yeah. She said that I um have an overactive sweat gland.  
Doctor: Does hidradenitis suppurativa sound familiar? 
Patient: It does. 
Doctor: I ask because it's also included in your last visit with your dermatologist. 
Patient: Those are the red bumps, right? 
Doctor: Yes. There's a note here that you could've potentially had Staph with it as well. 
Patient: Oh yeah. I've also had a lot of abscesses in the past.  
Doctor: It looks like you've had them in your upper mid thigh, vulva area, and the area between your vulva and anus. 
Patient: For about two years now. 
Doctor: Right. And a history of asthma? 
Patient: Correct.
