Doctor: How old are you, young boy?
Patient: I am twenty nine. 
Doctor: And you got right side shoulder pain? Is this something new?
Patient: Yes. That is right.
Doctor: What were you doing when this happened?
Patient: I think I was picking up a stack of cardboard, then putting it down on the ground and twisting to the right side. And sometimes I was throwing them a little bit as well.
Doctor: Okay, and how far you were lifting them or bending?
Patient: Around here, till waist level.
Doctor: Okay.
Patient: I heard a pop and since then there is pain in this area. I can't lift heavy items. Basically I have no strength.
Doctor: Okay. And this all started from June thirty two thousand and four?
Patient: Yes, that's right. The pain is in the lateral part of the back of my shoulder. 
Doctor: How did you lose your arm if I may ask?
Patient: Motorcycle accident.
