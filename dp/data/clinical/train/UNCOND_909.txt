Doctor: And you said you're right handed, correct?  
Patient: Yep. Right handed. 
Doctor: Okay, great. I've made note of it in your chart. I have one more question to ask regarding tobacco and alcohol. Do you smoke or drink? 
Patient: I don't do either. I can't even think of the last time I took a sip of alcohol.
