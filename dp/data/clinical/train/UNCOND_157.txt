Doctor: Good morning, young lady, how old are you?
Patient: Good morning, doctor. I'm thirteen.
Doctor: Good, and what seems to be the problem today? Mom, can you explain for me? 
Guest_family: Well, if you look, doctor, her back posture is very rounded.
Doctor: I think, it's rounding about the thoracic spine. Is there a family history of this problem? 
Guest_family: Yes, on my side, my aunt and grandfather had, um, kyphosis. 
Doctor: Yes, that's what this is. This is thoracic kyphosis to be specific. Has she seen another doctor for this? 
Guest_family: Yes, we saw another orthopedist.
Doctor: What did they recommend? 
Guest_family: They recommended we come in for further observation, so we're here for a second opinion. 
Doctor: Good, is there any back pain, numbness or tingling?
Patient: No, I don't have any of that. 
Doctor: Is there any weakness, numbness or tingling in your legs and arms, my dear? 
Patient: No, I'm very strong, especially for my age. 
Doctor: Are you going to the bathroom with no problem? 
Patient: Yes, doctor, everything is regular there.
