Doctor: Can you tell me more about your daughter's injury? 
Guest_family: Well, we came in in November, and she was diagnosed with an acute on chronic right slipped capital femoral epiphysis. 
Doctor: Did she have surgery on this? 
Guest_family: Yes, let me look at my notes, I have it written down here, um, a situ pinning. 
Doctor: Remind me, how old are you, dear? 
Patient: I'm thirteen now. 
Doctor: Okay, thank you. So, um, if you look her at the x rays, it appears that the screw is now going into the hip joint. 
Guest_family: They didn't see that before. What can we do about this? 
Doctor: We'll need to do another operation in order to remove this screw and put a shorter one in. We need to do the surgery because this can cause further joint damage.
Guest_family: Are there any risks of infection from this surgery? 
Doctor: Overall, the risk of infection is very low, honestly its less than one percent. 
Guest_family: That's good to hear, will she go to sleep during surgery? 
Doctor: Yes, we'll use anesthesia the entire time. She won't feel a thing. 
Guest_family: What does recovery look like for this surgery? 
Doctor: I expect her to heal up very well, but there's always a risk of some changes in sensation and motion, and she may be stiff for some time following everything. Other risks include bleeding, but I would not worry about these things. 
Guest_family: Okay, how does that sound, honey? Would you like to do this?
Patient: Yeah, I want to get back to playing sports with my friends.
Guest_family: I agree, Doctor, we'll do the surgery.
