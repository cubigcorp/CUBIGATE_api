Doctor: Okay, let me quickly examine him. Mom do you give the permission? I will quickly check his genitalia. Can you pull his pants down?
Guest_family: Sure, you can check. 
Doctor: Well, everything looks fine, his penis and testes are normal shape and size for his age. No fluid accumulation or swelling in the scrotum area, no evidence of herniation there.
