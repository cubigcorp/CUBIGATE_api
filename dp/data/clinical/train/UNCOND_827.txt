Doctor: Hello sir, how are you? 
Patient: I don't know, I don't know whether I am good, or my problem is getting worse and that is the reason I got myself to your clinic for a neurological consult. 
Doctor: Hm, don't worry! We will take care of you, let me start by taking some details. 
Patient: Sure!
Doctor: So were you referred by someone or-
Patient: Oh, no I referred myself to your clinic. 
Doctor: Okay. And what is your age? 
Patient: I am sixty four years young!
Doctor: Ah, that's clever, you certainly look very young. And which is your dominant hand? Are you left handed, or right?
Patient: I am right handed. 
Doctor: So, tell me what is going on with you?
Patient: Well, lately I am having difficulty remembering names and phone numbers or even events. 
Doctor: Well, it's not uncommon.
Patient: I know, but I am usually very good at remembering things. I would have not worried that much, but it was brought to my attention by my clerical staff.
Doctor: Oh, okay. What do you do? 
Patient: Well, I was the catholic priest at my parish, like we have our own small administrative district and church. 
Doctor: Okay, and when did you notice first that you are forgetting things? 
Patient: Around twelve months back. 
Doctor: And did it cause any problem at work or any mishaps? 
Patient: No, not at all! No social or professional faux pas whatsoever. 
Doctor: Okay, I have my notes let me put the date, oh what is the date-
Patient: It's twenty eighth of February.
Doctor: Thank you!
