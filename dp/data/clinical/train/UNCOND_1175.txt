Doctor: Good afternoon, sir. Did you see the nurse already? 
Patient: Yes, I just saw her. 
Doctor: Great, you're seventy eight years old, correct?  
Patient: Yes, I'm not as young as I used to be.
Doctor: Who is? What seems to be the problem today, sir? 
Patient: I have right hand pain, and it's been there for a while now. 
Doctor: Are you having numbness sir? 
Patient: Yes, and I can't move it very well, either. 
Doctor: Which fingers are you having these symptoms in? 
Patient: Well, I told you it's all in the right hand, but it's in the index and middle fingers. 
Doctor: Are your fingers catching? 
Patient: What does that mean, doctor?
Doctor: Are you having any problems extending your fingers?
Patient: Yes, they seem to lock up when I try to extend my fingers. 
Doctor: Have you seen another doctor for this? 
Patient: Yes, I had an E M G and it showed, um, carpal tunnel on both hands. 
Doctor: It's in both hands, but the right is worse than the left, correct? 
Patient: Yes, that's correct. 
Doctor: What treatments have you had for this? 
Patient: I only had an injection so far. 
Doctor: Did this help at all?
Patient: Well, some, but it was really only temporary relief. Is there surgery for this? 
Doctor: Yes, I think you'd be a good candidate for surgery. 
Patient: What are the risks of infection from the surgery?
Doctor: It's less than one percent. We use prophylactic antibiotics to control for infection the entire time. 
Patient: Even though it's on my hand, will I be asleep for this procedure? 
Doctor: Yes, you won't feel a thing. 
Patient: Okay, yes. I'd like to do the surgery.
