Doctor: Do you know of any family history of kyphosis? 
Patient: I'm sorry, what's that?
Doctor: It has to do with rounding of the spine. Does anyone in your family have a rounded posture?
Patient: Actually, yeah, my great grandmother had that, and my mom would talk about my second cousin, he had it too.
