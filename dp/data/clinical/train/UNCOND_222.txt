Doctor: Hi there! What brings you in today? 
Guest_family: I think my baby got into the ant bait. I am not sure if he consumed any of it but he was under the counter and it was in his hands.
Doctor: What kind ant bait did he get into?
Guest_family: It was the one with Borax in it. 
Doctor: Do you have a picture of it? 
Guest_family: Yes. It is in my phone.
