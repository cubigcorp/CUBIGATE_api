Doctor: Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past? 
Patient: Yeah, I quit two years ago. But before that I used to smoke two packs per day. I first started smoking as a teenager. 
Doctor: Do you drink at all?  
Patient: I used to drink six packs of beer plus two additional drinks a day for many years. Good news is that I've been dry for two years now. 
Doctor: Any illicit drug use, such as cocaine, marijuana or heroin? 
Patient: No none of that.
