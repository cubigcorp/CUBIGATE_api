Doctor: Have you ever had surgery, ma'am?
Patient: Yeah, I've had a few. First, I had, um, tubal ligation, and three milk ducts removed.
Doctor: What year was that in?
Patient: That was in, um, nineteen seventy nine. 
Doctor: Great, thank you. What else have you had done? 
Patient: I had a breast biopsy in nineteen eighty nine, and a colonoscopy in two thousand seven. 
Doctor: Thank you, do you have any children? 
Patient: Well, doctor, I've been pregnant four times, but I've had three children. 
Doctor: I'm so sorry to hear that. Did you have a C section with any of them? 
Patient: No, doctor. I had a natural birth for all of them.
