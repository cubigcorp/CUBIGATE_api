Doctor: How long did it take for your body to react? 
Patient: Bout thirty minutes or so. 
Doctor: Did you experience any shortness of breath, itching, or hives? 
Patient: No, surprisingly. 
Doctor: And no tongue swelling or trouble swallowing? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: Have you gotten stung in the past? Or is this your first time? 
Patient: I got stung about a month ago. No redness or swelling like I do now. I guess it could've been due to the Benadryl I took as soon as it happened. 
Doctor: Did you take Benadryl again today? 
Patient: No, I figured I'd be okay. 
Guest_family: He takes Metoprolol and Hydrochlorothiazide for his blood pressure.

Patient: Yeah."
