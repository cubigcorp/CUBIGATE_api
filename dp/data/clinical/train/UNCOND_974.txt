Doctor: Hello. You must be his mom.
Guest_family: Yeah, he started having a sore throat last night. And that's why we are here. His eyes have been really puffy. Uh, we gave him some Benadryl. 
Doctor: Hm. 
Patient: I had a stuffy nose and it was hard to breathe. 
Doctor: When did it all start?
Guest_family: It started yesterday. All of a sudden, he started complaining saying, “Mama my nose is not working,” and yeah, I noticed he was breathing from his mouth. 
Doctor: Any fever or any other symptoms?
Guest_family: Yeah, he had some low grade fever. He looked very tired and when I asked him he said that, “I feel like I cannot stand. I have no energy. I want to just lie down.” 
Doctor: I can notice that his voice is a little bit hoarse. How's he eating and drinking?
Guest_family: He's eating and drinking normally. 
Doctor: Any shortness of breath or pain in your stomach? 
Patient: No. 
Doctor: Any diarrhea or vomiting? 
Patient: No.
