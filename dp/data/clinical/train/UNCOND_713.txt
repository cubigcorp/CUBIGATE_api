Guest_family: Hi, how are you?
Doctor: I am well, how's the baby? I see that he is eight pounds and thirteen ounces, and he was born viaâ€¦?
Guest_family: Yes, C section. Yeah, he is he has never been hospitalized. He was born a week early.
Doctor: Okay, I would like to ask you some questions about the pregnancy and other history. 
Guest_family: Yes, sure go ahead.
Doctor: Great, have you had any infections during pregnancy like G B S or S T D infections?
Guest_family: No, I haven't, I only had thumb and toenail infections and we treated that with rubbing alcohol. We have a history of boils in the family, so I am not afraid of minor infections like this. 
Doctor: Did you smoke during pregnancy? 
Guest_family: Yes, I did, but stopped after five months.
Doctor: Sir, have you had any S T D while she was pregnant?
Guest_family_2: No, I was not diagnosed with anything unusual.
Doctor: Great, so looks like you were discharged in forty eight hours and no more hospital stays for you.
Guest_family: That is correct.
