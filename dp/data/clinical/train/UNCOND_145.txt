Doctor: Hello sir, what brings you here today? Also, please confirm your age for the records.
Patient: I am seventy years old. I am here for nothing particular but I just have discomfort on the right side. 
Doctor: We did electromyography study. This was to assess the health of muscles and the nerves in your body. When did you first notice this discomfort? 
Patient: About five years ago. After my stroke. I've been to a neurologist before. 
Doctor: Yeah, I can see that you have taken different kinds of medications, but nothing seems to help you. 
Patient: That sounds right. Nothing seems to help me to get rid of this discomfort.
Doctor: How often do you check your sugar levels? 
Patient: I do it at home. Mainly two to three times a day. I increase or decrease the amount of insulin that I take based on my numbers.
Doctor: Don't you consult anyone before doing that? 
Patient: It's been so many years now. I do it all by myself. 
Doctor: We did reevaluations of your symptoms. It turned out to be all negative. Do you smoke? 
Patient: I used to chew tobacco a lot and then there were drinks. I used to drink at least half a bottle of single malt in one night. I quit everything five years ago after my stroke.
