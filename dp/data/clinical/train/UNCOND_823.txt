Doctor: Hello, miss. How are you doing today? It looks like we are evaluating C O P D and emphysema.
Patient: Yes, the last time I was seen in Pulmonary Medicine Clinic was March two thousand and four. 
Doctor: It has been quite some time. How are you feeling?
Patient: I have actually been hospitalized for psychiatric problems and now live in a nursing facility. Things have not been too great. I don't like living there.
Doctor: I understand the frustration. When you live in a nursing facility you lose a lot of your freedom.
Patient: I want to live back in my apartment, but I know I am too ill to care for myself. 
Doctor: In spite of all of that how are your respiratory issues?
Patient: I feel pretty stable. I still have shortness of breath when I do activities, but with my condition I feel like that is something I will have to live with.
Doctor: Unfortunately, that is the nature of the disease. I am happy to see that the pulmonary disease has not changed significantly since your last visit. 
Patient: The only thing that seems to have changed is that I have a small cough and produce some mucus. 
Doctor: Okay. Do you have any fever or chills?
Patient: No, none of that. 
Doctor: Do you experience any chest pains? I want to check especially since you have been coughing up some mucus. 
Patient: No, I luckily do not have any chest pains.
