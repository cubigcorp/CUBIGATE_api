Doctor: How is your pain today? 
Patient: Eh it's been a rough few days that's for sure. The pain started almost instantly. 
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been taking anything for it? 
Patient: I actually saw a chiropractor the other day. My neck pain has been unbearable. 
Doctor: Is the pain localized to one area? 
Patient: Yeah. 
Doctor: And it hasn't radiated to any other part of your body? 
Patient: Nope.  
Doctor: Are you experiencing a pins and needles sensation at all? 
Patient: Not yet. 
Doctor: Any back pain?  
Patient: Oh yeah. I'd say it's even worse than my neck pain. The pain starts in my lower back and radiates down both legs. 
Doctor: Any pins and needles as a result of this back pain? 
Patient: No, no pins and needles. 
Doctor: Are you experiencing stiffness in your back? 
Patient: The stiffness seems to worsen when I exert myself during activities.  
Doctor: Has it impacted your sleep at all? 
Patient: Honestly, I haven't gotten much sleep since the accident. It's been so difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep in. I've never had back problems until now. 
Doctor: This accident sure did a number on you. 
Patient: No kidding. 
Doctor: You had mentioned experiencing stiffness during strenuous activity. Is it mostly during the day or does it progress into the night? 
Patient: Yeah, it's mostly during the day. 
Doctor: I see. 
Patient: The pain does improve a bit when I lay flat or sit up in a chair. 
Doctor: But despite this, your activity continues to be restricted, correct? 
Patient: Yeah, correct. 
Doctor: I meant to ask if you felt better after chiropractic treatment? 
Patient: A little bit, but not much. 
Doctor: And would you say your pain has overall gotten worse or remained the same? 
Patient: It's stayed more or less the same. 
Doctor: And to confirm, you didn't have neck or lower back problems prior to the accident? 
Patient: Yeah.
