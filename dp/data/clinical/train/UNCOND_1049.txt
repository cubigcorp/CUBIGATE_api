Doctor: Any important family history, any medical issues in the family?
Patient: Well, my father died of a heart attack. I don't remember how old he was, but I do remember that he had some long run heart issues. 
Doctor: What about your mom? 
Patient: My mom's death was a mystery for all of us. She died of some complications because of the dental procedures. So never got to know what killed her. 
Doctor: Do you have kids? Are they all doing good health wise?
