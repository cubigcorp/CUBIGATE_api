Doctor: Do you have a history of surgeries? 
Patient: I had a bone fragment removed from my right arm. I had a D and C done a long time ago. It was a treatment for H P V. More recently I had an ovarian cancer staging biopsy done. I have not heard back with the results yet. I only had it done less then a week ago. 
Doctor: How are you feeling after the biopsy? 
Patient: I had a significant amount of pain for two to three days after. I feel better now.
