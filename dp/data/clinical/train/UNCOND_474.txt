Doctor: Good afternoon, young man. 
Patient: Good afternoon, doctor. 
Doctor: How old are you, sir?
Patient: I'm thirteen. 
Doctor: So, what brings you in today?
Guest_family: Well, at first, we went to Sierra Pacific Orthopedic Group, and he had an M R I that showed, um, O C D in the left knee. 
Doctor: Yes, I see that from the report. 
Guest_family: So, we're here for a second opinion on that.
Doctor: Yes, we should do surgery on this knee. There's gross instability of the fragment, and we don't want that get worse. 
Guest_family: Okay, that's about what we've heard so far. What are the risks of infection of the procedure? 
Doctor: It's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. Other risks include bleeding, changes in sensation of the limb, changes in motion, failure to relieve pain or restore the articular cartilage, the possible need for another procedure, and possible early arthritis. I would not worry, though. These things are rare.
Guest_family: Okay, will he be asleep the entire time?
Doctor: Yes, he won't feel a thing. 
Guest_family: Okay, my husband agrees. We want to do the surgery.
