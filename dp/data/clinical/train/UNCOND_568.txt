Doctor: Do you have any major medical conditions that I should know about? 
Patient: Actually, I have a whole list of conditions. I have them written down here. 
Doctor: Thank you, so I see congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, azotemia, hyperglycemia, coronary artery disease, and a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Oh, and azotemia.
Patient: Yes, I told you I have a lot going on. 
Doctor: Are you taking any medications? 
Patient: Well, they wanted me to take Coumadin but I had, um, a subdural hematoma so they would let me. 
Doctor: I see, what about any neurological or psychological conditions? 
Patient: Well, I have depression, and I've had panic attacks while taking Doxepin before. 
Doctor: I see here that you also have perioperative anemia, does that sound familiar? 
Patient: Yes, another doctor told me about that. 
Doctor: Do you have any other symptoms you'd like to report today? 
Patient: Um, I'm having some difficulty swallowing.
