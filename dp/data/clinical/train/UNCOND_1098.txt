Doctor: Good afternoon, sir, and who's the patient today? You, or your daughter?
Guest_family: Not me today, its my daughter.
Doctor: And how old are you, dear?
Patient: I'm eighteen. 
Doctor: What seems to be the problem today?
Patient: I hurt my right knee while playing tennis, um, it was about three days ago now. It really hurts. 
Doctor: I see, tennis, huh? Was there any contact involved?
Patient: No, I took a step wrong when I went for an awkward shot. 
Doctor: Are you able to stand on this knee?
Patient: Not well, it feels unstable, like I'm going to fall over.  
Doctor: Have you ever hurt this knee before?
Patient: Yeah, tore my ACL in two thousand eight. 
Doctor: I assume you had surgery for that?
Patient: Yeah I did, um, with Doctor X. He called it an, um, A C L reconstruction.
Doctor: How did you recover from this?
Guest_family: She didn't do well, she didn't do what we or the others doctors suggested, and the knee never really got the same tightness back.
Doctor: What did they do about that?
Guest_family: I have it in my notes here, they did an, um, A C L revision. That was done by Doctor Y.
Doctor: When was that done?
Guest_family: Looks like it was at the end of two thousand eight. 
Doctor: Following the revision, how did you cover?
Patient: I did everything they said, I did it exactly as they wanted, and I did fine until this last injury.  
Doctor: Good, was there any instability following the revision?
Patient: Nope, I was really stable.
