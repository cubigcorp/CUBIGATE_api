Doctor: Hello there, I am Doctor Nathan. 
Patient: Hello.  
Doctor: How old are you?
Patient: I am forty eight?
Doctor: Do you get regular periods? 
Patient: No, I didn't get any periods for the last year after my surgery. 
Doctor: Any hot flashes?
Patient: Yes, it's been happening for the last several months. Sometimes I feel hot even in a fully air conditioned room. Other times I just feel like opening the refrigerator and standing in front of it.
Doctor: Any other symptoms?
Patient: I am also experiencing a lot of mood swings for the last few weeks.
Doctor: Based on all the symptoms my assessment would be mood swings along with postsurgical menopause. That would be the cause for your hot flashes.
