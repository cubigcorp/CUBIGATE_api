Guest_clinician: I was not able to get her complete history and review of systems. But she is scheduled for a bladder distension surgery.
Doctor: Okay.
Guest_clinician: Also, I am not sure if she is off Coumadin because of the surgery. 
Doctor: Oh yeah, she has chronic AFib and she is on Coumadin. Not sure if she has stopped the medicine due to upcoming surgery.
Guest_clinician: The only thing she could tell was that she was having tremors for the past three to four years and was diagnosed with early Parkinson's disease.
Doctor: Alright.
