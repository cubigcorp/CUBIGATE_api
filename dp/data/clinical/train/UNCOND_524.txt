Doctor: Hello. Before we begin your visit, could I ask a few questions to fill in some missing information? 
Patient: Yeah, that's fine. 
Doctor: Does your family have any health related problems? 
Patient: Yeah, we do. We have a strong history of heart disease. I think it could be because we drink a lot. 
Doctor: So, would you say alcoholism runs in your family? 
Patient: Oh, yeah. We drink a lot every day. Beer, liquor, you name it.
