Doctor: Hello, miss. What is the reason for your visit today? 
Patient: I think I have some warts on my back end where the poop comes out. 
Doctor: I see. When did you start noticing them? 
Patient: I think like three to four weeks ago. 
Doctor: Do you feel any pain or discomfort? 
Patient: It itches a little, but I haven't felt any pain yet. Is this normal for a twenty two year old? 
Doctor: I'll have to take a look, but you'll be fine. Are there any other symptoms that you are aware of?
Patient: Nope. Just the warts and itchiness.
