Doctor: Hi, there. 
Patient: Hi. 
Guest_family: Hi! It is nice to meet you. 
Doctor: It is nice to meet you as well. You are the husband, correct? 
Guest_family: Yes. I am the husband. 
Doctor: How long have you two been married? 
Guest_family: We have been married for forty eight years. 
Doctor: Do you live in the same household? 
Patient: Yes. 
Doctor: Do you have a primary care physician?
Patient: No, I am currently looking for someone. I have also been looking for someone to see for my mental health issues. 
Doctor: I have a few recommendations I can give to you if you would like.
Patient: I would like your recommendations for both.
Doctor: Are you working currently? 
Patient: No, I am not. I used to work as a registered nurse. It has become too much for me right now. 
Doctor: Do you drink alcohol or use any recreational drugs? 
Patient: I don't do any drugs. I drink very rarely. I only drink is social situations. 
Doctor: Have you ever taken any prescription drugs, muscle relaxants or sedative medications? 
Guest_family: I don't think that she has ever taken muscle relaxants or sedative medications without prescriptions. I give her, her medications every day so she doesn't forget. 
Doctor: Oh, okay. 
Guest_family: She does have a pattern of self-prescribing for minor illness. She loves WebMD. 
Doctor: Okay. How have you been feeling lately? Have you been participating in social activities? 
Patient: Since this last March I have been feeling more social and have been doing things on my own more. 
Guest_family: She used to never leave the house unless I go with her. She has defiantly been more independent lately. She even went and met a friend for coffee the other day. 
Doctor: That is great to hear.
