Doctor: Do you have any significant medical conditions in your history that I should know about? 
Patient: What, like high blood pressure? 
Doctor: Well, it could be anything from high blood pressure, to depression, to something as serious as cancer. 
Patient: Oh, no, I don't have anything like that, at least not that I know if.
