Guest_clinician: Is the patient being admitted for disseminated C M V infection? 
Doctor: Yes. I suspect they have possible C M V pneumonitis as well. 
Guest_clinician: Are they on immunosuppressants? 
Doctor: Yes. They have polymyositis and they're taking Prednisone and Methotrexate.  
Guest_clinician: Got it.
