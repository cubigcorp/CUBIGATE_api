Doctor: Hello, sir. Before we begin your visit, could you verify your age and ethnicity for me, please?
Patient: I'm forty nine years old, and I identify as white.  
Doctor: Thank you. What brought you in today?
Patient: I was referred to you so that I could get whatever's wrong with me under control. 
Doctor: I see. What seems to be happening? 
Patient: I hurt the back of my leg pretty bad this past year when I was in A B C D. 
Doctor: What part of your leg? 
Patient: The back of my left thigh. 
Doctor: I see. So just the leg? 
Patient: I also hurt my kneecap from a boat when I was out in the water fishing. 
Doctor: Was that severe? 
Patient: It was a whole show. A helicopter came down and swooped me to X Y Z Hospital, where I got surgery. 
Doctor: I can see you still have an external fixation on your knee so that the fracture heals. Did the hospital give you a report on the surgery? 
Patient: Yeah, they did. Here you go. 
Doctor: Thank you. Let me take a look. So, it looks like you underwent grafting and full thickness skin grafting for closure for a large defect in your left posterior thigh. That seems to be healed in the gluteal fold on the left area. 
Patient: Yeah. Whatever that means. 
Doctor: Let me examine the area. 
Patient: Go for it. 
Doctor: I can see several areas that have hypergranulation tissues around the graft site and low in the leg.
Patient: Is that bad? 
Doctor: I don't think so. Are you feeling any symptoms of a fever or anything? 
Patient: No, I'm not. 
Doctor: That's good. You don't have any infections then.
