Patient: No, no one I can think of. 
Doctor: Do you know of anyone who has had foot deformities or neuropathy in their arms or legs?
Patient: No, not one person comes to mind.
Doctor: Great. Does anyone in your immediate family have a high arch?
Patient: No, at least no one that I know of.
Doctor: And you said that your aunt or sister has type two diabetes?
Patient: My aunt. She's had it for some time now.
