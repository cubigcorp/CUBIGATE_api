Doctor: Are you allergic to anything? 
Patient: As in drugs? 
Doctor: Yes, sorry. I was referring to drug allergies.
Patient: Oh yeah. I'm allergic to Sulfa drugs. 
Doctor: What happens when you take Sulfa drugs? 
Patient: Break out in a terrible rash. I remember I had to go to the E R the first and last time I took it. 
Doctor: Wow, I'm sorry. Rashes can be very uncomfortable and sometimes require immediate attention. 
Patient: Yeah, so no more Sulfa drugs for me. That's for sure.
