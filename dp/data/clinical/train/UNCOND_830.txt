Doctor: Hi there! Welcome to the Neurology clinic, sir. 
Patient: Hi! Thank you. 
Doctor: What brings you in to the clinic today? 
Patient: I was diagnosed with binocular diplopia twenty five years ago but I haven't had much of an issue with it until about a year ago. 
Doctor: What did you notice as far as symptoms?
Patient: Suddenly, I started having double vision.
Doctor: Did the double vision happen more than one time? 
Patient: It has been happening almost every day off and on through out the day. 
Doctor: How long do the episodes last? 
Patient: They last for only a few minutes at a time. When I was first diagnosed years ago it happened for a year and then it stopped happening. It was not happening as often as it is now. 
Doctor: Did you ever receive any treatment for your binocular diplopia? 
Patient: No. It spontaneously resolved and so I didn't need to seek any treatment. Back when all this was happening it had two episodes of a drooping eyelid. I thought I had myasthenia gravis but I was told that that was probably not the case. 
Doctor: What eyelid was drooping? 
Patient: I don't remember? 
Doctor: What is your dominate hand? 
Patient: I am right handed. 
Doctor: And how old are you? 
Patient: I am sixty seven. 
Doctor: Involving the double vision, does it become worse when looking at distant objects? 
Patient: Yes. 
Doctor: When you look at objects off to either side of midline does it become worse?
Patient: Yes. That makes it worse too. When I put my hand over one eye is goes away.
Doctor: Do you have any other symptoms related to the vision issues? 
Patient: No.
