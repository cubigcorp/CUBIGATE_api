Doctor: You recently turned sixty seven, correct?
Patient: Yes. Sixty seven years young.
Doctor: Are you right or left handed?
Patient: Right.
Doctor: When were you first diagnosed with Parkinson's? 
Patient: September first of nineteen ninety five. 
Doctor: Do you remember who diagnosed you?
Patient: A local doctor I was seeing at the time. A year before my diagnosis, I had a few falls and episodes of lightheadedness. I also noticed that I was staggering a lot more when walking. 
Doctor: Did you lose consciousness during any of your falls?
Patient: Not that I know of. I had noticed that I was losing my normal voice to a degree. On top of losing my normal voice, my handwriting became smaller and smaller. I don't ever remember writing so small. Something seemed really off to me.
Doctor: I'm sure that was difficult to experience. 
Patient: It was very difficult. Two months prior to being diagnosed, I started to move much slower than before.
Doctor: By slower, do you mean the movements of your arms and legs were slower and impaired?
Patient: Yes. I was prescribed Sinemet back in September of nineteen ninety five.
Doctor: Did you notice any improvement while taking it?
Patient: None. I was pretty disappointed and discouraged as a result. I have problems with coordination and walking without staggering even today.
Doctor: Noting that it's February thirteenth nineteen ninety six. 
Patient: I felt weak in the morning and worse as the day went on.
Doctor: Are you experiencing any other symptoms, such as stroke like events, vision changes, seizures, or problems with moving and coordinating your arms?
Patient: No.
Doctor: Any headache, nausea, vomiting, chills, or fever?
Patient: No.
