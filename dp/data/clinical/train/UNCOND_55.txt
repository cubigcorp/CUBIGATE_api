Doctor: Where do you work, miss? 
Patient: Well, you see, I am a civil engineer. Right now, due to pandemic like everyone else I am working from home. 
Doctor: Are you working full time or is your disability affecting that?
Patient: No, I can only work on half time. This disability does not let me work full time. I need to go to physical therapy quite frequently on and off and I also have a baby who consumes a lot of my time. 
Doctor: Do you smoke or drink? 
Patient: No, I've never done any of them.
