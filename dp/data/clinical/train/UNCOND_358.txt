Doctor:  Hi, how are you?
Patient: I am okay.
Doctor: Do you have any bone pain or issues around that? 
Patient: No, I do not.
Doctor: So, they gave you a dose of Tylenol here in the emergency department to treat your pain.  Is your pain under control? 
Patient: Yes, with medication I feel it is better, but I want to be removed from the backboard.
Doctor: Okay, let's get you off. Yeah, your C T scans of the abdomen appeared normal.  And there was no sign of bleeding.  I believe, you just have a contusion and abrasion to abdomen from the seatbelt and likely from the airbag as well.
Patient: Oh okay.
Doctor: It's good that you can stand and walk through the emergency department without difficulty. I do not see any abrasions or lacerations.
Patient: Yeah, nothing like that and I can walk.
