Doctor: So how long have you two been married?
Guest_family: We've been together for twenty seven years now.
Doctor: Oh wow, that's so wonderful to hear. How did you guys meet?
Guest_family: We actually met in high school. We dated for some time and then we took a break, but we ultimately got back together. 
Doctor: Aw, high school sweethearts. I have a few more questions to ask. 
Guest_family: Shoot.
Doctor: Any tobacco, hard drugs, or alcohol?
Guest_family: She doesn't do any of that.
Doctor: Great. And do you know of any medical problems that run on her side of the family?
Guest_family: Nothing major.
Doctor: I see.
