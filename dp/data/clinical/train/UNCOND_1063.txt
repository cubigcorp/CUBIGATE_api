Doctor: How's your family? 
Patient: They're doing well, thank you. My three boys are all grown up. Hard to believe they're living their own as young professionals. One of them is actually a G I doctor in San Diego, California. 
Doctor: You must be so proud of your boys. 
Patient: My wife and I always say how lucky we are. 
Doctor: I'm sure. And I have a few more questions before we wrap up. 
Patient: Go for it. 
Doctor: Do you drink or smoke? 
Patient: I smoke about a third of a pack a day and I drink every now and again, but nothing crazy.
