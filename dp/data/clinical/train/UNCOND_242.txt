Doctor: So, sir, what do you do for a living? 
Patient: Right now, I'm working with Chevron as a petroleum engineer. 
Doctor: That's fantastic. So, do you drink?
Patient: Um, I'd say I drink socially, like if I'm at a party or something. 
Doctor: Sure, me too. Do you smoke?
Patient: No sir, I don't do that.
