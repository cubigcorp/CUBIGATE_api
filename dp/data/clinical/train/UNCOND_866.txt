Doctor: Good morning, sir. Before we begin, how old are you?
Patient: Good morning, doctor. I'm forty one. 
Doctor: Thank you, and how long have you had this left knee pain?
Patient: It's been about two years now. 
Doctor: Is there an injury?
Patient: Yeah, I sprained my MCL while playing hockey back then. 
Doctor: What kind of symptoms have you had in this knee since then?
Patient: Well, the knee locks up on me, I can't extend it all the way, and it just hurts really bad if I try to. 
Doctor: Do you feel any instability?
Patient: No, not at all.
