Doctor: Do you drink alcohol? 
Patient: Nope! I use to occasionally, very long time ago. But not anymore.
Doctor: Okay and how bout cigarettes? Do you smoke or vape?
Patient: No, none of those.
Doctor: And no drugs and stuff, right? No snorting, I V or anything right?
Patient: Right, I don't do drugs either, never did. Even though pot is legal here, I never ever felt like trying. 
Doctor: That's a good thing. 
Patient: Yeah.
