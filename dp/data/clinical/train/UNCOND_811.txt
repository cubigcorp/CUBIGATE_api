Doctor: Any past surgeries that I should know of?
Patient: I had a hip replacement years ago.
Doctor: Both hips?
Patient: My left.
Doctor: Total?
Patient: Yeah.
Doctor: Got it.
Patient: I also had my uterus and appendix removed. I was young when I had my appendix taken out.
Doctor: Do you happen to remember who did your most recent surgeries?
Patient: Wish I did. I'd have to look back at my records and get back to you. I have everything at home.
Doctor: That's no problem. I should be able to look it up from my end, too.
