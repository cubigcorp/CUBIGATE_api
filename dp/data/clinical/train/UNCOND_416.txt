Doctor: So, sir, tell me about your knees, how long have they been bothering you? 
Patient: Well, I'm sixty nine years old now, so I'm not as young as I used to be. But, these old knees have been bothering me for a couple years now. 
Doctor: What kind of symptoms do you notice in these knees? 
Patient: I hear clicking noises, which really bothers me when I'm going up stairs. There's also some stiffness when I try to move them. 
Doctor: Were you previously a pretty active guy? 
Patient: I absolutely used to be, and had no problems, but now this pain is affecting my daily life and activities.
