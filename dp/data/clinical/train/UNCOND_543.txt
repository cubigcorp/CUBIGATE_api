Doctor: Hello there, how are you?
Guest_family: I am little scared. 
Doctor: I understand, so how old is she? 
Guest_family: She is ten days old today. 
Doctor: And just wanted to confirm the ethnicity is Caucasian, right?
Guest_family: Yes. 
Doctor: Okay, so tell me what's going on with her?
Guest_family: I was feeding her and then I suddenly noticed this unusual jerky movement in both her arms and legs. 
Guest_family: It lasted about a minute. 
Doctor: When did you first notice it? 
Guest_family: The first day when I was feeding her, she was barely a day old.
Doctor: Okay, and how many times till now?
Guest_family: About six times. 
Doctor: Did you notice any interrupted breathing or bluish color around her mouth? 
Guest_family: No.
Doctor: While the episode occurs do you notice any color changes in the baby? 
Guest_family: No.
Doctor: Did you happened to notice any arching of the back or eyes rolling back?
Guest_family: No, it usually happens while she is sleeping, so I didn't notice her eye movements. But I am able to wake her up and stop the hand and leg movements. 
Doctor: Okay. Otherwise, is she feeding well and is active? 
Guest_family: Yes, absolutely! Although she falls asleep a lot during breast feeding but other than that everything is fine.
Doctor: And how often are you feeding her and for how long? 
Guest_family: I breast feed her every two to three hours for about fifteen to twenty minutes. 
Doctor: Okay, and how many dirty diapers? 
Guest_family: Well, her pee diapers have increased to up to eight and I would say about six to seven poopy diapers a day.
Doctor: And did you notice the color of her poop? 
Guest_family: Yeah, it's like dirty yellowish color. 
Doctor: Okay.
