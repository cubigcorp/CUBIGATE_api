Doctor: Do you have any past history of psychiatric treatment of struggles? 
Patient: I had some extreme fatigue back in nineteen ninety one. I was in therapy for six years. They had me on Prozac. I took in for that whole six years while I was in therapy. When I started the Prozac, I had just started working again. The stress at work was overwhelming. 
Doctor: Was this the first time that you had feelings for fatigue and depression? 
Patient: No. I have always had a little sadness or depressed time in my life but it had been manageable before all the work stress started happening. 
Doctor: How are you feeling these days? 
Patient: I get somewhat sad from time to time but I don't dwell on things anymore. 
Doctor: Do you ever have thoughts of selfharm or suicidal thoughts? 
Patient: No.
