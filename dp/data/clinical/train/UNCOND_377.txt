Doctor: Hello, it's nice to meet you. 
Patient: It's nice to meet you as well. 
Doctor: My name is Doctor X and I will be taking care of you today. 
Patient: Thank you. 
Doctor: I've been told that you'd like a refill on your Xanax prescription and something to help you break your smoking habit. 
Patient: Yes, I feel like I've tried everything in the book and I still can't break the habit. One of my buddies was telling me about this medicine called Clantix or something like that. 
Doctor: Yes, I've heard of Chantix. We can look into it and see what's best fit. 
Patient: Okay, great. Since moving back home, I've ran out of Xanax. 
Doctor: How long have you been taking it? 
Patient: Almost a year now. I usually take it on days where my anxiety is really bad. 
Doctor: I see here that you also have mesothelioma in the lining of your stomach, is that correct? 
Patient: Yes, I need to find a new cancer specialist that's closer to where I live. 
Doctor: Are you currently experiencing any pain? 
Patient: Not at the moment, but I do get pain when I eat sometimes. Other times it's when I'm not even doing anything. It's been chronic so nothing new. 
Doctor: Do you take anything for the pain? 
Patient: I haven't in a while. 
Doctor: When were you diagnosed with mesothelioma? 
Patient: About six or so months ago.
