Doctor: Hi, the weather outside is beautiful, did you get some sunshine?
Patient: Yes in fact I came in walking.
Doctor: Great way to get some exercise in.
Doctor: ok so what's going on?
Patient: I am having a bellyache.
Doctor: Since when?
Patient: Oh, it's been a while now.
Doctor: Can you tell me more about your pain like how did it start and what exactly are you feeling?
Patient:  Ok so the pain started as dullache but it is constant right here in the middle upper part of my stomach. And sometimes it is moving to the back.
Doctor: Can you tell me if it is stabbing pain and if it is related to any specific time of the day?
Patient: Sure, so i do get episodes of stabbing pain but they are not related to meals. Once the wave comes it lasts for only a minute or so.
Doctor: Can you tell me when exactly you noted it?
Patient: Approximately six months back. I took over the counter antacids and got some relief so i did not go to doctor. But two months back it got worse, I do get occasional nausea and vomiting.
Doctor: I can see that they found H pylori positive infection and treated you with triple drug therapy for two weeks and then gave you antacid omeprazole. But it did not improve your pain.
Patient: Yeah that's right.
Patient: Do you know I lost twenty pound of weight since all these symptoms began but i have been also admitted for poor appetite.
Doctor: Ok tell me how are your bowel movements and if you see any blood in stools?
Patient: I get two to three loose bowel movements a day but no blood in stool or anywhere. 
Doctor: Are you taking any pain medication over the counter? Do you drink alcohol and maybe you are vomiting blood?
Patient: No no, nothing like that.
Doctor: Can you tell me if any change in position changes the quality of pain? do you have any fever?
Patient: No position changing have no effect, no fever or anything.
Doctor: Have you been exercising before all this?
Patient: Yes I have had very active and healthy lifestyle.
