Doctor: Hello. How are you both doing today? 
Guest_family: We're doing great. The E D told us to come here. We're here to see if we could get the stuff in his leg taken out. 
Doctor: I see. Did he have a fracture before? 
Guest_family: Yeah, he did. Here's the report from the surgery from October two thousand and seven. 
Doctor: Great. Let me take a look. It looks like he had a distracted left lateral condyle fracture. He then underwent screw compression to fix the fracture, correct? 
Guest_family: That's correct. 
Doctor: Perfect. So, now we just have to remove the hardware that was used to fix the fracture, right? 
Guest_family: Yeah, that's correct. What are the risks of the surgery? 
Doctor: The risks include the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of extremity, failure of removal of hardware, failure to relieve pain or improved range of motion.  
Guest_family: Oh, wow. That's a lot. Could you go over the benefits?
Doctor: Of course. Before I do, I just need to confirm your son's age. 
Guest_family: He can tell you. 
Patient: Hi. I'm five years old. My birthday is in four months. 
Doctor: Thank you. Happy almost birthday. 
Guest_family: He gets excited about birthdays. I just have a few more questions, but it looks like we're going to go through with the surgery.
