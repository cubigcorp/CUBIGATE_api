Doctor: Good afternoon, ma'am. Can you confirm your age for me, please? 
Patient: Sure, good afternoon, doctor. I'm sixty one years old. 
Doctor: Great, what brings you in for a visit today? 
Patient: I have some notes here with me, but I have a history of polyarteritis nodosa mononeuritis multiplex. 
Doctor: Is this in your legs, or arms? 
Patient: Um, it's in my legs. 
Doctor: I see here that you have sleep apnea too. 
Patient: Yeah, I was involved in an overnight sleep study on C P A P and oxygen. 
Doctor: Why did they do this?
Patient: It was in order to determine why I had difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep.
Doctor: Have You had any other treatments? 
Patient: Yeah, I had a review done while I was in the hospital about two weeks ago, I have the results right here. 
Doctor: Thank you, so, how is your leg pain been managed?
Patient: Um, I take pretty substantial doses of opioids in order to control it.
Doctor: Do you have any swelling?
Patient: Yes, I take Lasix for my leg swelling.
Doctor: How do you sleep with the C P A P?
Patient: I can fall asleep with it, but I usually rip my mask off because I toss and turn.
Doctor: How would you rate your quality of sleep?
Patient: I'd, um, say it's pretty terrible.
