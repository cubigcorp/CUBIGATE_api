Doctor: I'm reviewing my notes from your last visit. Your last visit was on May tenth two thousand four, correct? 
Patient: Yes, that's right. 
Doctor: Has there been any change since your last visit? 
Patient: Well, I'm having some increased paranoia. 
Doctor: Have you been treated, and are you taking medicine for this? 
Patient: Yes, and it's actually gotten a lot better with the medicine another doctor gave me.
