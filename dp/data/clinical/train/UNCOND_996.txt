Doctor: Hi there, how is it going?
Guest_family: Hi doctor, I am his son Ethan.
Doctor: Nice to meet you. 
Doctor: So, I see your father has a history of drug abuse, right?
Guest_family: Yes.
Patient: Not abuse, I just used to do drugs. The last time I really made a big mistake I injected the heroine directly into both of my thighs and unfortunately, I got these ulcers which are not going away.
Doctor: Yeah, this is really unfortunate. I can see these open wounds, it's because of the chronic abscesses.
Guest_family: The right thigh looks worse than the left one.
Doctor: Yeah, I see that. How old is your father?
Guest_family: He is sixty two. 
Doctor: Does he have any other medical issues like sugar or blood pressure?
Guest_family: No. 
Doctor: Okay, I think we need to surgically remove this whole area and then do a reconstruction.
Guest_family: And is that the only way?
Doctor: According to me, yes! I mean the wounds are not healing and it is only getting worst. 
Guest_family: Okay then we will follow whatever you suggest. 
Doctor: Okay.
