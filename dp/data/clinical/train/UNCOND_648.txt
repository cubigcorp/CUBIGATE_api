Doctor: How long have you had this rash? 
Patient: Not long. Less than a day if I had to guess. 
Doctor: Is it causing you any pain? 
Patient: No, it's just really itchy. I tried applying Cortisone to it, but it didn't help much. 
Doctor: Is the rash localized to the left arm? 
Patient: Yeah. I've only noticed it on my left arm.
