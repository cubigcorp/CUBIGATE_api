Doctor: Do you use tobacco products? Cigarettes, chewing tobacco or vaping? 
Patient: I used to smoke a pack a day.  I quit that awful habit in nineteen eighty five. 
Doctor: Do you work? 
Patient: I am retired.
Doctor: Wonderful. Is your husband retired with you?
Patient: Yes. We both are. I cannot imagine working a full time job at seventy six years old.
