Doctor: What brings this little guy in today? 
Guest_family: He's been complaining of a sore throat since last night. I noticed his eyes were really puffy before he went to bed and that's when I gave him some Benadryl. At that time, he also seemed nasally. 
Doctor: Sorry to hear that. Did he have a fever? 
Guest_family: When I took his temperature last night, it was one O one.
Doctor: And did you give him anything for the fever? 
Guest_family: I was worried about giving him something on top of the Benadryl. 
Doctor: I see. And how has he felt otherwise? 
Guest_family: He appears more sluggish than usual. Fortunately, he's eating and drinking well. 
Doctor: Has he been coughing at all? 
Guest_family: No, but his voice has been a kind of raspy. 
Doctor: Any shortness of breath? 
Guest_family: Um no. 
Doctor: How about any episodes of vomiting, diarrhea, or stomach pain? 
Guest_family: No, I don't think so.
