Doctor: Hello, how are you?
Patient: I am doing well. Just here for a follow up visit. 
Doctor: Are there any changes from the last visit in your social history or medical history?
Patient: No. Whatever you wrote last time should be correct. I was here just three months ago. I was here December third of two thousand and three.
