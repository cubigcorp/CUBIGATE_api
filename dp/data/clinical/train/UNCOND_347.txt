Doctor: What is your family medical history? 
Patient: My dad had Alzheimer's disease. He is in a facility that cares for him now.
Doctor: I am sorry that must be hard. 
Patient: It is. My aunt, his sister helped me get everything set up for him. She had a stroke last month. 
Doctor: Oh no. How is she doing now? 
Patient: She is home now but her husband is having to help take care of her. The doctors said it looks good for her to have a full or almost full recovery. 
Doctor: That is a relief. 
Patient: Yes, it is! 
Doctor: Any other family health problems that you know of? 
Patient: No not that I know of.
